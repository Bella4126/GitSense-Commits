# Activity Summary for 1/19/2026

## 2:41:36 PM
The `App.jsx` file underwent a minor but significant update on 1/18/2026, within a short span between 12:51:27 PM and 12:51:39 PM. The core change involved correcting the API endpoint URL used for fetching model responses.

Specifically, the `fetchModelResponse` function's `fetch` call was updated:
- **Previous URL (12:51:27 PM):** `https://loca/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`
- **Updated URL (12:51:39 PM):** `http://localhost:8080/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`

This change fixes a likely typo (`https://loca` to `http://localhost:8080`), making the application correctly point to a local development server for its API requests, likely a backend proxy or server running on port 8080. The rest of the file's logic, state management (for prompts, responses, loading status, and response order), and UI structure for comparing LLM models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) remained consistent across both entries.
