# Activity Summary for 1/18/2026

## 1:31:57 PM
The file `c:\Users\ss\llm-comparison-ui\src\App.jsx` was updated twice in quick succession on **1/18/2026**, first at **12:51:27 PM** and then at **12:51:39 PM**.

The core change in `App.jsx` involves the `fetchModelResponse` function. Initially, the API endpoint for fetching model responses was `https://loca/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`. This was promptly corrected in the subsequent update to `http://localhost:8080/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`, indicating a fix from a placeholder or incorrect local development URL to the standard `localhost` address.

The file's overall structure and functionality remain consistent between these updates, revolving around a React application designed to compare responses from different LLM models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama). It manages shared prompts, displays model responses, tracks loading states, and determines the response order, highlighting the fastest model. The only recurring element in the changes is the specific function `fetchModelResponse` being targeted for the API endpoint correction.

## 2:41:54 PM
The primary change observed is within the `c:\Users\ss\llm-comparison-ui\src\App.jsx` file.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ss\llm-comparison-ui\src\App.jsx`**: This React component, responsible for an LLM comparison UI, contains state management for prompts, model responses, loading states, and the order in which responses are received. It defines three LLM models: OpenAI (GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude), and Ollama (Gemma 2). The component handles sending a shared prompt to all models concurrently and displaying their responses, highlighting the fastest model.

**Significant Timestamps and Changes:**

*   **1/18/2026, 12:51:27 PM**: The `fetchModelResponse` function was attempting to fetch data from `https://loca/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`. This URL appears to be an incomplete or placeholder address.
*   **1/18/2026, 12:51:39 PM**: A rapid update occurred where the `fetchModelResponse` function's API endpoint was corrected. The URL was changed from `https://loca/api/...` to `http://localhost:8080/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`, specifying a local development server on port 8080.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   The most prominent pattern is a swift correction of an API endpoint within the `App.jsx` file. This suggests an initial setup or typo was quickly resolved to point to a functional local backend server.
*   The overall structure of `App.jsx` remains consistent across both timestamps, indicating that the core functionality and UI layout were already established, with only a specific network request parameter needing adjustment.
