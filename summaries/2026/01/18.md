# Activity Summary for 1/18/2026

## 1:31:57 PM
The file `c:\Users\ss\llm-comparison-ui\src\App.jsx` was updated twice in quick succession on **1/18/2026**, first at **12:51:27 PM** and then at **12:51:39 PM**.

The core change in `App.jsx` involves the `fetchModelResponse` function. Initially, the API endpoint for fetching model responses was `https://loca/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`. This was promptly corrected in the subsequent update to `http://localhost:8080/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`, indicating a fix from a placeholder or incorrect local development URL to the standard `localhost` address.

The file's overall structure and functionality remain consistent between these updates, revolving around a React application designed to compare responses from different LLM models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama). It manages shared prompts, displays model responses, tracks loading states, and determines the response order, highlighting the fastest model. The only recurring element in the changes is the specific function `fetchModelResponse` being targeted for the API endpoint correction.
