# Activity Summary for 3/31/2025

## 11:28:14 AM
The log shows development of a task management system with a backend and frontend.  Changes span from 12:29 AM to 11:26 AM on March 31st, 2025.

**Backend:**

* **`db.ts` (12:29 AM):** This file handles the MongoDB connection.  Initial commits contained commented-out code, indicating iterative development. The final version directly uses `process.env.MONGO_URI`.

* **`User.ts` (12:33 AM):** Defines the User model using Mongoose, incorporating bcrypt for password hashing.  Similar to `db.ts`, early versions were commented out.

* **`tasks.ts` (12:33 AM):** Contains controllers for task management (CRUD operations).  The code uses try-catch blocks for error handling and consistently returns 500 error for server issues and 404 for task not found. Commented-out code suggests refactoring or iterative development.

* **`auth.ts` (12:33 AM):**  Handles user registration and login, using JWT for authentication. It uses `process.env.JWT_SECRET` for token generation.  Commented-out code is present, again suggesting iterative development.

* **`auth.ts` (routes):** Defines API routes for authentication (`/register`, `/login`).

* **`tasks.ts` (routes):** Defines API routes for task management (`/`, `/:id`), protected by middleware (`protect`).

* **`app.ts` (12:37 AM):** The main application file, setting up Express, CORS, and connecting to the database.  It mounts the authentication and task routes. Commented-out code present shows iterative development.

* **`server.ts` (12:37 AM):** Starts the server on the specified port (environment variable `PORT` or 5000). Early version was commented-out. Later, this was updated to correctly import and use the `app` instance.

* **`server.js` (10:56 AM and 11:20 AM):**  This file underwent significant changes. The initial version was a simple API endpoint responding "API is running...". The final version correctly starts the server using the updated `app.js`.

* **`.env` (10:54 AM, 10:57 AM, 11:25 AM, 11:26 AM):**  Multiple updates to the `.env` file show configuration changes, notably the addition of `JWT_SECRET` and modifications to `MONGO_URI` string formatting.

* **`package.json` (11:05 AM):** Defines project dependencies (including `bcryptjs`, `mongoose`, `jsonwebtoken`, `express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, and `nodemon`), scripts, and metadata.

* **`app.js` (11:09 AM):** This file shows a change where some lines of code were shifted from `require()` to `import`.


**Frontend:**

* **`Dashboard.tsx` (12:39 AM and 10:34 AM, 10:39 AM):** This component displays tasks, allows adding, updating, and deleting them.  Multiple updates to this file suggest iterative development and addition of UI features.  ARIA labels were added in the later commits.  The file also switched between `.tsx` and `.jsx` extensions.

* **`Login.tsx` (12:41 AM):** Handles user login.

* **`Register.tsx` (12:41 AM):** Handles user registration. Both `Login.tsx` and `Register.tsx` show similar structure and features.  These also switched between `.tsx` and `.jsx` extensions.

* **`types.ts` (12:42 AM):** Defines TypeScript types for the application.  The file switches between using interfaces and JSDoc type definitions.

* **`axios.ts` (12:42 AM):** Configures axios for API calls, including JWT authentication.

* **`main.tsx` (12:44 AM and 12:51 AM):** The main application entry point for the React app.  The file also switched between `.tsx` and `.jsx` extensions and changes in the usage of `createRoot` method.

* **`App.tsx` (12:44 AM):** Sets up routing, including private routes for authenticated users. The file also switched between `.tsx` and `.jsx` extensions.

* **`main.jsx` (12:51 AM):**  A duplicate of `main.tsx` that was created and then used.

* **`tailwind.config.js` (10:37 AM, 10:38 AM):** This file defines the Tailwind CSS configuration. Custom colors were initially added but then were removed in a later commit.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Commented-out code in many files suggests iterative development and refactoring.
* Consistent error handling in backend controllers (try-catch blocks, specific HTTP status codes).
* Use of `localStorage` for storing authentication tokens in the frontend.
* Multiple files were renamed from `.tsx` to `.jsx` or vice-versa.


In summary, the log documents the full development cycle of a task management application, from initial setup to adding features and refinement. The later commits focused more on UI refinements and bug fixes.


## 12:40:07 PM
The log shows environment variable configurations for a task management system.  The backend's `.env` file (updated at 11:36:09 AM on 3/31/2025) sets up a MongoDB connection (`MONGO_URI`), a server port (`PORT`), and a JWT secret (`JWT_SECRET`). The frontend's `.env` file (updated at 11:36:31 AM on 3/31/2025) defines the API URL (`VITE_API_URL`), which points to the backend's port.  The timestamp shows that the frontend configuration was set after the backend, likely to ensure the API is running before the frontend attempts connection.  Both files use `.env` for environment-specific configurations.
