# Activity Summary for 3/4/2025

## 5:17:07 PM
The log shows development of a simple e-commerce product display.  The main components are `App.jsx`, `ProductTab.jsx`, `Product.jsx`, and `Price.jsx`.  `Product.css` styles the product cards.

Development started around 4:23 PM on March 4, 2025, with the creation of the basic app structure (`App.jsx`). Between 4:42 PM and 4:50 PM,  `ProductTab.jsx` and `Product.jsx` were developed, rendering a list of products with old and new prices.  The `Price.jsx` component was added to handle price display.

Between 4:54 PM and 4:57 PM, `ProductTab.jsx` was modified multiple times to improve layout using flexbox, centering the products.  At 4:56 PM,  `Product.css` was created to style the product cards.  The App header was adjusted in `App.jsx` between 4:59 PM and 5:00 PM.

Significant styling changes to `Product.css` occurred between 5:01 PM and 5:16 PM, involving adjustments to margins, padding, and height. Several iterations modified the `Product` height, settling around 230px.

Between 5:10 PM and 5:16 PM, `Price.jsx` underwent numerous modifications, primarily focused on styling the old and new price elements using inline styles. The background color of the price container was experimented with, before settling on `lightgrey`.

The overall pattern shows iterative development, with frequent adjustments to styling and layout. The developer appears to be experimenting with different CSS properties and layouts to achieve the desired visual presentation. There's a significant amount of experimentation seen in the css file, along with various height adjustments in the product section.
