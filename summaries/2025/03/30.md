# Activity Summary for 3/30/2025

## 10:43:51 PM
The log shows modifications to `c:\Users\ss\OneDrive\Desktop\WP\mern-WeddingPlanner\api\index.js`.  The file is a Node.js Express server for a MERN stack application.

The first entry (3/30/2025, 10:07:05 PM) shows an initial, partially commented-out version of the server.  It includes imports for Express, Mongoose, dotenv, user and auth routers, and sets up basic server functionality with error handling middleware.  The MongoDB connection string is read from the environment.  However, error handling for missing environment variables is absent.

The second entry (3/30/2025, 10:12:41 PM) significantly improves the code.  Key changes include:

* **Explicit `.env` file loading:** The `dotenv.config()` call now explicitly specifies the path to the `.env` file (`./.env`).
* **Robust error handling for missing MONGO URI:**  The code now explicitly checks if `process.env.MONGO` is defined, exiting the process with an error message if it's not found. This addresses a potential point of failure identified in the previous version.
* **Improved MongoDB Connection:**  The use of `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` options is added for more robust MongoDB connection.
* **Code organization:**  The imports of the user and auth routers are moved to a logical location after the server initialization.  The commented-out code was completely removed.
* **Port specification:**  The server now listens on a port specified by the environment variable `PORT` or defaults to 3000.  Output messages to the console are improved.

In summary, the changes between the two entries demonstrate a clear progression towards a more robust and well-structured server application with improved error handling and environment variable management.  The primary focus of the changes was improving the reliability and clarity of the server's connection to the MongoDB database and error handling, while also better organizing the code.
