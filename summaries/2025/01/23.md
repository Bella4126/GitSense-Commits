# Activity Summary for 1/23/2025

## 11:49:30 PM
The log shows a single code modification to `c:\Users\ss\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder\my-app\src\App.js` on January 23rd, 2025 at 11:28:48 PM.  The change involves updating the App component to import and render three components: `Sex`, `Ass`, and `Boo` from respective JSX files. The code includes comments indicating a correction to the import statement for handling multiple imports and clarifying the use of a React fragment (`<> </>`) to return multiple JSX elements.  The comment also notes the limitation of returning only a single element without wrapping in a container.
