# Activity Summary for 1/26/2025

## 11:58:12 AM
The log shows modifications to `c:\Users\ss\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder\my-app\src\product.jsx`  between 11:54 AM and 11:56 AM on January 26, 2025.  The changes center around rendering a `Price` component within the `Product` component.

Initially, the `Price` was rendered as a string within a `<p>` tag.  Over the course of three commits (11:56:06 AM, 11:56:43 AM, and 11:56:50 AM),  the code was refined to correctly render the imported `Price` component as a JSX element. The final commit (11:56:50 AM) simply removed a stray semicolon.  The comments within the code remain unchanged throughout, providing context on the code's purpose and commenting on conditional rendering.  No other files were modified in this log.
