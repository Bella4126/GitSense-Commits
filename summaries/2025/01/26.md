# Activity Summary for 1/26/2025

## 11:58:12 AM
The log shows modifications to `c:\Users\ss\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder\my-app\src\product.jsx`  between 11:54 AM and 11:56 AM on January 26, 2025.  The changes center around rendering a `Price` component within the `Product` component.

Initially, the `Price` was rendered as a string within a `<p>` tag.  Over the course of three commits (11:56:06 AM, 11:56:43 AM, and 11:56:50 AM),  the code was refined to correctly render the imported `Price` component as a JSX element. The final commit (11:56:50 AM) simply removed a stray semicolon.  The comments within the code remain unchanged throughout, providing context on the code's purpose and commenting on conditional rendering.  No other files were modified in this log.


## 12:58:13 PM
The log shows development of a React component displaying product information.  The `ProductTab.jsx` component renders a list of products using the `Product.jsx` component.  `Price.jsx` displays old and new prices.

Initially (12:01 PM and 12:06 PM),  `Product.jsx` and `ProductTab.jsx` were created,  rendering basic product titles without prices.  `ProductTab.jsx` was updated at 12:07 PM, adding another product.

At 12:28 PM, a `Price.jsx` component was created but didn't receive any props. This was updated at 12:37 PM to accept and display `Oldprice` and `Newprice` props.

Significant changes happened between 12:32 PM and 12:57 PM:

* **12:32 PM:** `ProductTab.jsx` was updated to pass an `Idx` prop to `Product.jsx`.
* **12:32 PM:**  `Product.jsx` was updated to include arrays `Oldprice` and `newprice` hardcoded.
* **12:50 PM:** `Product.jsx` passed hardcoded `Oldprice` and `newprice` values to `Price.jsx`.
* **12:53 PM:** The `Price.jsx` component's prop names were corrected for consistency (to `Oldprice`, `newprice`).
* **12:57 PM:** `Product.jsx` was finalized, using the `Idx` prop from `ProductTab` to dynamically access the correct old and new price from the arrays.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, starting with basic components and gradually adding features like dynamic price display using props and array indexing.  The comments in `product.jsx` suggest the developer is learning React and is documenting their understanding.
