# Activity Summary for 4/9/2025

## 10:27:08 AM
The log shows several edits to two React component files: `ManageUser.jsx` and `ManageBooks.jsx`.

`ManageUser.jsx` (first update at 9:34:28 AM, last at 9:53:24 AM): This component displays a user management interface.  It includes tabs for different user types, bulk upload functionality, and a modal to create new users. The later edits appear to be reverting some of the changes; specifically, the final version shows a change where the "Create User" button now has a `bg-white` style instead of a transparent background.  The modal that appears when attempting to create a user without Institution details remains consistent throughout the edits.

`ManageBooks.jsx` (first update at 9:38:10 AM, multiple updates until 9:51:07 AM): This component shows a book management interface. It features searching, filtering (by 'All', 'Mapped', and 'Unpublished' statuses), adding books, uploading books, deleting books, and downloading book data.  The component uses `localStorage` to store book data.  Significant changes were made between the first version and subsequent ones.  The most notable change is the introduction of `useCallback` for the `handleFilter` function to optimize performance  Initially, the entire component was commented out in one edit (9:39:31 AM) before being restored with the addition of `useCallback` hook to `handleFilter` function (9:40:35 AM and 9:51:07 AM). Another edit (likely at 9:39:31 AM) shows the component being entirely commented out before being uncommented with minor changes later.  The final versions maintain the core functionality but with improved performance due to the use of `useCallback`.
