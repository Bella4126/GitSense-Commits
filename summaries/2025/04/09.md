# Activity Summary for 4/9/2025

## 10:27:08 AM
The log shows several edits to two React component files: `ManageUser.jsx` and `ManageBooks.jsx`.

`ManageUser.jsx` (first update at 9:34:28 AM, last at 9:53:24 AM): This component displays a user management interface.  It includes tabs for different user types, bulk upload functionality, and a modal to create new users. The later edits appear to be reverting some of the changes; specifically, the final version shows a change where the "Create User" button now has a `bg-white` style instead of a transparent background.  The modal that appears when attempting to create a user without Institution details remains consistent throughout the edits.

`ManageBooks.jsx` (first update at 9:38:10 AM, multiple updates until 9:51:07 AM): This component shows a book management interface. It features searching, filtering (by 'All', 'Mapped', and 'Unpublished' statuses), adding books, uploading books, deleting books, and downloading book data.  The component uses `localStorage` to store book data.  Significant changes were made between the first version and subsequent ones.  The most notable change is the introduction of `useCallback` for the `handleFilter` function to optimize performance  Initially, the entire component was commented out in one edit (9:39:31 AM) before being restored with the addition of `useCallback` hook to `handleFilter` function (9:40:35 AM and 9:51:07 AM). Another edit (likely at 9:39:31 AM) shows the component being entirely commented out before being uncommented with minor changes later.  The final versions maintain the core functionality but with improved performance due to the use of `useCallback`.


## 12:36:49 PM
The log shows updates to three React component files within a Learning Management System (LMS) admin frontend.

`OfflineEnrollment.jsx`:  This component displays and manages offline enrollment requests.  Between 12:04:58 PM and 12:09:46 PM, a significant change was made.  The initial version was commented out, and a new, updated version was added. The core functionality remained the same: displaying a list of students, enabling searching and filtering by batch, and offering actions (rename, delete, archive). The key change was the addition of pagination controls at the bottom of the table.


`ManageUser.jsx`: At 12:10:28 PM, this component, which handles user management, was updated.  The component includes tabs for different user types, bulk upload functionality, and a user creation feature.  However, attempting to create a user triggers a modal alerting the user to first complete institution details. This modal provides a link to add institution details and a cancel button.


`ManageBooks.jsx`: This component manages books, allowing for adding, uploading, filtering ('All', 'Mapped', 'Unpublished'), searching, deleting, and downloading book data.  Minor updates between 12:19:46 PM and 12:20:00 PM were made.  The code remains largely unchanged, suggesting a small code modification or reformatting rather than a substantial feature update. The component utilizes local storage to persist book data and renders a grid of `BookCard` components.  An empty state is displayed if no books exist.  A dropdown menu allows for adding books either manually or through upload.
