# Activity Summary for 4/11/2025

## 12:08:07 PM
The log shows development of a React application.  At 12:02:17 PM on 4/11/2025, `Advances.jsx` was updated. This component displays a searchable table of advances, with features to add new advances via a form. The form allows input for date, reference number, amount, report name, and trip name.  The UI includes a header with search, notification, and user settings icons.

Subsequently, `App.jsx` was updated twice.  The first update at 12:02:52 PM  routed the root path ("/") to the `Advances` component.  This was corrected at 12:03:08 PM, changing the root path to display the `Courses` component and routing "/advances" to the `Advances` component instead.  This suggests a refactoring of the application's routing to better organize the components.


## 1:49:02 PM
The log shows development of a React frontend application for managing expenses, specifically advances and reports.

**`Advances.jsx` (4/11/2025, 12:49:47 PM):** This component was created to handle advances.  It includes features for searching, adding new advances via a form, selecting and deleting multiple advances, and tabbed navigation ('pending' and 'all' advances). The UI uses a table to display advances with checkboxes for selection.  A modal form appears for recording new advances.  Lucide-React icons are used throughout the UI.

**`App.jsx` (4/11/2025, 12:50:22 PM & 4/11/2025, 12:51:12 PM & 4/11/2025, 1:30:44 PM):** This file shows the routing configuration of the application. Initially, placeholder content existed, which was subsequently removed. The application's routes were updated to include `/advances` and `/courses` initially, later removing `/courses` and then finally adding `/reports`.

**`main.jsx` (4/11/2025, 12:50:46 PM):** This file sets up the React application using `react-dom/client` and `react-router-dom` for routing.  It renders the `App` component within a `StrictMode` and `BrowserRouter`.


**`Reports.jsx` (4/11/2025, 1:30:22 PM, 4/11/2025, 1:41:40 PM, 4/11/2025, 1:46:19 PM, 4/11/2025, 1:48:27 PM):**  This component, responsible for displaying and managing expense reports, underwent several iterations. Initially, it had a hardcoded list of reports with limited functionality.  Subsequent updates added:

* **Data Separation:** The component was refactored to handle different report types ('all-trips', 'all-reports', 'pending').  Separate state variables (`allTripsData`, `allReportsData`, `pendingApprovalData`) were introduced to store data for each type.
* **Dynamic Data Handling:** The component now uses a `switch` statement to display reports based on the selected tab (`activeTab`).
* **UI Improvements:** The UI was enhanced with better styling, improved layout, and more descriptive labels.  The delete functionality is now tied to the currently active tab's data.  Status display uses color-coding.


A pattern of using Lucide-React icons for UI elements is consistently used across both `Advances.jsx` and `Reports.jsx`.  Both components share similar structure including header with search, actions, and a main section with a table for data display.  The development process involved a significant refactoring of `Reports.jsx` to improve data management and UI presentation.  The `App.jsx` file shows a gradual addition of routes reflecting the development of new features.
