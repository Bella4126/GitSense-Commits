# Activity Summary for 4/11/2025

## 12:08:07 PM
The log shows development of a React application.  At 12:02:17 PM on 4/11/2025, `Advances.jsx` was updated. This component displays a searchable table of advances, with features to add new advances via a form. The form allows input for date, reference number, amount, report name, and trip name.  The UI includes a header with search, notification, and user settings icons.

Subsequently, `App.jsx` was updated twice.  The first update at 12:02:52 PM  routed the root path ("/") to the `Advances` component.  This was corrected at 12:03:08 PM, changing the root path to display the `Courses` component and routing "/advances" to the `Advances` component instead.  This suggests a refactoring of the application's routing to better organize the components.
