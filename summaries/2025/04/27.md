# Activity Summary for 4/27/2025

## 8:47:03 AM
The `ItemForm.jsx` component was updated on 2025-04-26 at 11:14:09 PM.  This React component is a form for creating or editing item data.  The update includes a significant overhaul of the form's structure and functionality. The form now uses a more modern UI framework (likely Tailwind CSS given the class names), and includes fields for: name, SKU, type (Goods or Service), description, rate, unit (dropdown with options), tax preference (Taxable or Non-Taxable), tax exempt checkbox, selling price (dropdown for One-time Flat or Recurring), enable portal checkbox, portal language (dropdown), and documents (with file upload indication).  Default tax rates (intra-state and inter-state) are displayed as read-only input fields. There is also a field for assigning a customer owner, linked to a "Learn More" resource. The component uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing form data and handling updates from a potentially passed `itemToEdit` prop.  The form submits data via an `onSave` prop function.  A cancel button, handled by an `onCancel` prop, is also included.  The changes reflect an improved user interface and enhanced data management capabilities.
