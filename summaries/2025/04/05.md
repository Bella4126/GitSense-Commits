# Activity Summary for 4/5/2025

## 12:41:02 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `App.jsx` and `StudyMaterials.jsx` on April 4th and 5th, 2025.  `App.jsx` underwent changes to its layout, primarily focusing on the styling and positioning of the sidebar and navbar.  Initially, the code had a simple layout. Then it evolved to incorporate local storage functionality with the addition of a `UseLocalStorage` component, and finally settled on a revised layout with improved padding and positioning using `aside` and `main` elements.  The significant changes in `App.jsx` occurred around 11:56 PM on April 4th and 12:40 AM on April 5th.

The `StudyMaterials.jsx` file shows a consistently commented-out code section throughout all revisions, possibly indicating incomplete or experimental code related to local storage. The file focuses on creating a UI for managing study materials.  It includes tabs for different material types, a file upload functionality, a search bar, and storage information.  While the core functionality remains the same across revisions, there's no substantial structural change to the component.  The comments "YE LOCAL STORAGE WALA H" consistently appear, suggesting local storage is a persistent, though apparently unfinished, aspect of the component.  Minor modifications to the commented-out code are seen between successive commits of `StudyMaterials.jsx`.

A new component, `UseLocalStorage.js`, was added on April 5th, 2025 at 12:09:56 AM. This component is a custom React hook designed to handle local storage interactions. It manages the storing and retrieving of data, including error handling, showing a clear intention to manage application state through local storage. The name of this component was changed from `useLocalStorage` to `UseLocalStorage` at 12:15:27 AM.  This small change in capitalization doesn't alter functionality, however it might reflect coding style preference updates.
