# Activity Summary for 4/5/2025

## 12:41:02 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `App.jsx` and `StudyMaterials.jsx` on April 4th and 5th, 2025.  `App.jsx` underwent changes to its layout, primarily focusing on the styling and positioning of the sidebar and navbar.  Initially, the code had a simple layout. Then it evolved to incorporate local storage functionality with the addition of a `UseLocalStorage` component, and finally settled on a revised layout with improved padding and positioning using `aside` and `main` elements.  The significant changes in `App.jsx` occurred around 11:56 PM on April 4th and 12:40 AM on April 5th.

The `StudyMaterials.jsx` file shows a consistently commented-out code section throughout all revisions, possibly indicating incomplete or experimental code related to local storage. The file focuses on creating a UI for managing study materials.  It includes tabs for different material types, a file upload functionality, a search bar, and storage information.  While the core functionality remains the same across revisions, there's no substantial structural change to the component.  The comments "YE LOCAL STORAGE WALA H" consistently appear, suggesting local storage is a persistent, though apparently unfinished, aspect of the component.  Minor modifications to the commented-out code are seen between successive commits of `StudyMaterials.jsx`.

A new component, `UseLocalStorage.js`, was added on April 5th, 2025 at 12:09:56 AM. This component is a custom React hook designed to handle local storage interactions. It manages the storing and retrieving of data, including error handling, showing a clear intention to manage application state through local storage. The name of this component was changed from `useLocalStorage` to `UseLocalStorage` at 12:15:27 AM.  This small change in capitalization doesn't alter functionality, however it might reflect coding style preference updates.


## 1:41:04 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `StudyMaterials.jsx` component and minor adjustments to `App.jsx`.  The primary focus of the changes is the implementation of file and folder management features within the `StudyMaterials` component.

**`StudyMaterials.jsx` Updates:**

* **Initial Version (4/5/2025, 12:42:21 AM):** This version was a rudimentary structure, lacking crucial elements like modal state management and local storage integration.  The code hinted at planned features involving file uploads and local storage interaction.

* **Significant Enhancement (4/5/2025, 12:43:24 AM):** This commit introduced a custom `useLocalStorage` hook to manage application state using local storage.  The component was significantly expanded to include:
    *  Functionality to add files and folders, storing them in local storage using the `studyFiles` and `studyFolders` keys respectively.
    *  File upload handling using `FileReader` to convert files to base64 before storage.  
    *  Data structures for files and folders, including `id`, `name`, `type`, `size`, `data`, `dateAdded`, and a `tab` property to associate them with specific tabs.
    *  Filtering of files and folders based on the active tab.
    *  Storage usage calculation.
    *  Display of files and folders in a table.

* **Subsequent Minor Updates (4/5/2025, 12:44:24 AM - 12:46:19 AM):** These commits involved minor refinements, primarily UI-related changes:
    *  The `select-none` class was added to a button to prevent text selection.
    *  `focus:outline-none` was added to a button for improved styling.
    *  Minor adjustments to padding and spacing within the layout (`App.jsx`).


**`App.jsx` Updates:**

* **Initial Version (4/5/2025, 12:43:42 AM):** This shows a standard React Router setup with routes for the home page, study materials, and individual components (`Navbar`, `Sidebar`).  It uses a `Layout` component to structure the main content area.

* **Layout Adjustments (4/5/2025, 1:18:37 AM - 1:20:02 AM):**  These commits adjusted padding and spacing in the `Layout` component to accommodate the `StudyMaterials` component more effectively.  The padding was removed and then readjusted in subsequent commits.  There was also a brief period where the whole `App.jsx` was commented out before being restored.

**Recurring Elements:**

* Extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
* Consistent use of SVG icons from `lucide-react`.
* Persistent usage of local storage via the custom hook (`useLocalStorage`).


In summary, the major development effort focused on building a robust file and folder management system within the `StudyMaterials` component, leveraging local storage for persistence.  Minor UI adjustments were made to improve the overall user experience.
