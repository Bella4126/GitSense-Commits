# Activity Summary for 4/6/2025

## 9:36:23 PM
The log shows development of a React component for managing study materials.  Several `.jsx` files were modified between 1:09 AM and 1:23 AM on April 6th, 2025.

`StudyMaterials.jsx` underwent the most significant changes.  Initially (1:09 AM), it contained a large, mostly commented-out, self-contained component.  Subsequent updates (1:14 AM, 1:19 AM, 1:20 AM, 1:20 AM, and 1:23 AM) progressively refactored the code, breaking it down into smaller, reusable components (`MaterialTab`, `SearchBar`, `MaterialTable`) and adding features.  These changes involved:

* **Component refactoring:**  The initial monolithic component was broken down into smaller, more manageable components for better code organization and reusability.
* **UI Enhancements:**  Addition of a search bar, tabbed interface (`MaterialTab`), and a data table (`MaterialTable`) to improve user interaction and display of study materials.
* **Add/Edit Modals:** Implementation of modals for adding files and folders, allowing file uploads and folder creation/editing.  These modals include input fields for file names, folder names, and descriptions.  File upload functionality was added.
* **Local Storage Integration:** Use of `useLocalStorage` hook for persistent storage of files and folders in the browser's local storage.
* **SVG Icons:** Reusable SVG icons for search, folder, upload, and dropdown functionalities were defined and used across the components.  These were consistent across the edits in `StudyMaterials.jsx`.

`MaterialTab.jsx` (updated 1:10 AM and 1:23 AM) and `MaterialTable.jsx` (updated 1:11 AM) are new files introduced as part of the component refactoring in `StudyMaterials.jsx`.  `MaterialTab.jsx` renders the tabbed interface for "Study Materials," "Live Class Recordings," and "Pre-Recorded Lectures." `MaterialTable.jsx` displays the list of folders and files in a tabular format, enabling editing and deletion of items.

`SearchBar.jsx` (updated 1:12 AM) provides a search functionality and displays the storage usage.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate a substantial improvement in the structure, functionality, and usability of the study materials management component, moving from a large, single component to a well-organized structure consisting of multiple smaller, reusable components.  The consistent use of SVG icons and local storage throughout shows a planned approach to development.
