# Activity Summary for 4/6/2025

## 9:36:23 PM
The log shows development of a React component for managing study materials.  Several `.jsx` files were modified between 1:09 AM and 1:23 AM on April 6th, 2025.

`StudyMaterials.jsx` underwent the most significant changes.  Initially (1:09 AM), it contained a large, mostly commented-out, self-contained component.  Subsequent updates (1:14 AM, 1:19 AM, 1:20 AM, 1:20 AM, and 1:23 AM) progressively refactored the code, breaking it down into smaller, reusable components (`MaterialTab`, `SearchBar`, `MaterialTable`) and adding features.  These changes involved:

* **Component refactoring:**  The initial monolithic component was broken down into smaller, more manageable components for better code organization and reusability.
* **UI Enhancements:**  Addition of a search bar, tabbed interface (`MaterialTab`), and a data table (`MaterialTable`) to improve user interaction and display of study materials.
* **Add/Edit Modals:** Implementation of modals for adding files and folders, allowing file uploads and folder creation/editing.  These modals include input fields for file names, folder names, and descriptions.  File upload functionality was added.
* **Local Storage Integration:** Use of `useLocalStorage` hook for persistent storage of files and folders in the browser's local storage.
* **SVG Icons:** Reusable SVG icons for search, folder, upload, and dropdown functionalities were defined and used across the components.  These were consistent across the edits in `StudyMaterials.jsx`.

`MaterialTab.jsx` (updated 1:10 AM and 1:23 AM) and `MaterialTable.jsx` (updated 1:11 AM) are new files introduced as part of the component refactoring in `StudyMaterials.jsx`.  `MaterialTab.jsx` renders the tabbed interface for "Study Materials," "Live Class Recordings," and "Pre-Recorded Lectures." `MaterialTable.jsx` displays the list of folders and files in a tabular format, enabling editing and deletion of items.

`SearchBar.jsx` (updated 1:12 AM) provides a search functionality and displays the storage usage.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate a substantial improvement in the structure, functionality, and usability of the study materials management component, moving from a large, single component to a well-organized structure consisting of multiple smaller, reusable components.  The consistent use of SVG icons and local storage throughout shows a planned approach to development.


## 10:36:23 PM
The code log shows development on a React-based Learning Management System (LMS) admin frontend.  Significant changes occurred between 10:00 PM and 10:34 PM on April 6th, 2025.

**`StudyMaterials.jsx`**: This component underwent several iterations.  Initially, it contained a complete implementation for managing study materials (adding files and folders, searching, displaying in a table), using local storage for persistence.  Then, it was completely commented out, only to be replaced by a simplified, functional component at 10:34 PM, which utilizes  `Header`, `FileTable`, and `AddMaterialModal` components. This final version incorporates search functionality, pagination, storage display, and an add material dropdown.  The use of local storage persists throughout.

**`Header.jsx`**: This component remained largely unchanged, providing a header with sections for Study Materials, Live Class Recordings, and Pre-Recorded Lectures.  Each section displays "No Items" initially. The only change is the timestamp, indicating that the component was either updated slightly, or perhaps simply touched during the build process.


**`FileTable.jsx`**: This component also evolved.  It started with basic file listing, edit, and delete functionalities. Then, it was commented out. The final version (10:30 PM) refactored the action menu to use a state variable (`activeMenu`) for better control of the dropdown visibility, improved the empty state visualization with an image placeholder, added a file icon based on file type, and added a pagination interface with previous and next buttons.

**`AddMaterialModal.jsx`**: This component's changes included  UI enhancements such as replacing placeholder cross icons with more visually appealing ones and adding icons representing files and folders. Functionality was improved to include specific placeholders for input fields, a dedicated area for folder description, and the introduction of a cost section for folders to display whether added materials will incur an additional cost.  It also underwent a change in positioning and styling at 10:29 PM.  Initially, it was a full-screen modal, later moved to a more contained section of the screen.

A recurring pattern is the use of comments to temporarily disable entire files. This suggests an iterative development process, where features were initially implemented, then potentially removed or heavily refactored before being reinstated in a refined manner. The overall evolution of the code shows a focus on improving the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), adding more robust error handling, file type detection, and cost management features.


## 11:36:21 PM
The log shows several React component files being modified between 10:43 PM and 11:33 PM on April 6th, 2025.  The `StudyMaterials.jsx` component undergoes the most revisions.  Initially, it was heavily commented out, suggesting a significant rewrite or refactoring.  The final version includes modals (`ViewModal`, `MappingModal`) and updates the UI, adding features like  "View" and "Mapping" actions alongside existing "Delete" and "Edit" functionalities within the `FileTable.jsx` component.  `FileTable.jsx` also receives styling updates, changing the table's appearance.  The changes in `StudyMaterials.jsx` consistently involve integrating the new modal components and updating UI elements (like button styles and storage display).  There's a recurring theme of enhancing the user interface and adding functionalities related to file management and course mapping.  The `MappingModal.jsx` and `ViewModal.jsx` components were added, providing the functionality to map batches and view study materials.  The final modifications to `FileTable.jsx`  improve the table's styling and layout.
