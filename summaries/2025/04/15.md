# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 10:55:38 AM
The file `c:\Users\ss\Expenses_frontend\src\Components\Trips\Trip.jsx` underwent two modifications on April 15, 2025.

The first change at 10:52:23 AM showed a commented-out version of the component's code.  The second change at 10:54:20 AM removed the comments, making the code active. This suggests a potential debugging or temporary commenting-out of the code in the first revision.  The core functionality of the component remained unchanged between the two versions; it's a React component displaying and managing a list of trips, with features for adding new trips, searching, selecting and deleting trips, and showing details.  The component uses the `lucide-react` library for icons and handles user interaction through state management (`useState` hook) for elements like the search query, form visibility, and selected trips.  The data structure for representing individual trips is consistent throughout.
