# Activity Summary for 4/10/2025

## 12:24:41 PM
The log shows several revisions to two files: `Courses.jsx` and `App.jsx`.  The `App.jsx` file underwent minor corrections between 11:23:07 AM and 11:24:33 AM, correcting a case error in the `Courses` component import. No functional changes were made.


The `Courses.jsx` file saw more substantial changes. The initial version (11:22:25 AM) displayed course information using a select element for user interaction.  A significant update occurred at 11:29:16 AM, replacing the select element with a button that reveals a dropdown menu for "Book demo," "Enroll," and "Details" options.  This involved adding state management (`openMenuId`) to control the menu's visibility.   Further revisions at 11:34:04 AM and 11:35:41 AM involved minor refinements to the `Courses` component: instructor names were shortened, the instructor's title was added, minor styling improvements were made (adding `space-x-6` and changing the image display).  Finally, the entire component was commented out and then re-added, indicating a potential temporary removal and then restoration of the component with the latest changes.  The final version at 11:35:41 AM also includes improved styling for the course image, applying a hover effect.  There is no change in core functionality of the component.


## 5:47:31 PM
The log shows development of a React application, specifically a student dashboard for an LMS (Learning Management System).

The primary focus is on the `App.jsx` and `Courses.jsx` components.  Initially, `App.jsx` was set up to route to a single course (`/course`), but this was quickly changed to handle multiple courses (`/courses`). The `Courses.jsx` component underwent significant changes between 1:35:14 PM and 1:42:09 PM.  This component was initially commented out, then implemented with a hardcoded list of courses, and finally refined in terms of structure and presentation. Instructor names were also shortened (e.g., "Alex Turner" to "A. Turner").  The most significant structural change  was moving the `Courses` component from the `Components/Courses` folder to the root `Components` folder at approximately 1:41:31 PM, requiring a corresponding path adjustment in `App.jsx`.


Between 1:40:24 PM and 1:42:46 PM, `App.jsx` saw several minor edits, mostly involving cleanup of commented-out code and ensuring proper imports of `Routes` and `Route` from `react-router-dom`.

Finally, the `main.jsx` file was updated around 1:45 PM to correctly wrap the `<App/>` component with  `<BrowserRouter>` to enable client-side routing functionality, and to import the CSS file `./index.css`. The comments `// ✅ Add this!` and `{/* ✅ Wrap App with BrowserRouter */}` were removed in a subsequent commit.
