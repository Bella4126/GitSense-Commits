# Activity Summary for 4/10/2025

## 12:24:41 PM
The log shows several revisions to two files: `Courses.jsx` and `App.jsx`.  The `App.jsx` file underwent minor corrections between 11:23:07 AM and 11:24:33 AM, correcting a case error in the `Courses` component import. No functional changes were made.


The `Courses.jsx` file saw more substantial changes. The initial version (11:22:25 AM) displayed course information using a select element for user interaction.  A significant update occurred at 11:29:16 AM, replacing the select element with a button that reveals a dropdown menu for "Book demo," "Enroll," and "Details" options.  This involved adding state management (`openMenuId`) to control the menu's visibility.   Further revisions at 11:34:04 AM and 11:35:41 AM involved minor refinements to the `Courses` component: instructor names were shortened, the instructor's title was added, minor styling improvements were made (adding `space-x-6` and changing the image display).  Finally, the entire component was commented out and then re-added, indicating a potential temporary removal and then restoration of the component with the latest changes.  The final version at 11:35:41 AM also includes improved styling for the course image, applying a hover effect.  There is no change in core functionality of the component.
