# Activity Summary for 4/24/2025

## 11:07:42 AM
The commit on April 24, 2025, at 10:16:44 AM modifies `EstimateForm.jsx`.  This React component is a form for creating or editing estimates.  Significant changes include the addition of extensive form handling logic using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. The component manages form data, including customer details (billing and shipping addresses), remarks, GST treatment, items (with quantity, rate, discount, and amount calculations), charges (shipping, adjustment), taxes (TCS), and attachments.  

The code features functions for:

*   Handling changes to individual form fields (`handleChange`).
*   Managing a list of items, allowing addition, removal, and updating of item details (`handleItemChange`, `handleAddItem`, `handleAddBulkItems`, `handleRemoveItem`).
*   Calculating subtotals and totals based on item amounts and other charges (`calculateSubTotal`, `handleChargesChange`).
*   Handling file uploads with size validation (`handleFileUpload`, `removeAttachment`).
*   Saving the estimate (`handleSubmit`).

The UI is built using a functional component with JSX, leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling. The form includes input fields, select elements, and a textarea for various estimate details.  Error handling is present for file upload size limits.  The component also displays the form data in a user-friendly way, particularly the address sections.
