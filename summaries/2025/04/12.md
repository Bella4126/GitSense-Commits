# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 9:43:50 AM
The `Advances.jsx` component, managing a UI for advances, underwent a significant update on 4/11/2025, 4:14:28 PM.  The primary change involved restructuring the `newAdvance` state.  Previously, it contained `date`, `reference`, `amount`, `reportName`, and `tripName` fields.  The updated version now includes `date`, `amount`, `username`, `applyToTrip`, `paidThrough`, `reference`, and `notes`. This suggests an expansion of the data captured for each advance, adding fields for user identification, payment method, and additional notes.  The core functionality of adding, searching, deleting, and filtering advances remains, but the data model has been enhanced to accommodate more comprehensive information.  The addition of `ChevronUp` icon from `lucide-react` is also noted, though its specific implementation within the code is not included in this snippet.
