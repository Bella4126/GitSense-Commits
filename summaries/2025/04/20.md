# Activity Summary for 4/20/2025

## 12:11:22 PM
The code log shows updates to three React components: `RecurringBills`, `ManualJournal`, and `VendorsCredit`, all occurring on April 20, 2025.  Each component displays a table of data (recurring bills, manual journals, and vendor credits respectively), allowing for creation, editing, deletion, and searching of entries.  A consistent pattern is the use of a dark/light mode toggle (`darkMode` state variable), pagination, search functionality, and bulk selection/deletion capabilities.

**`RecurringBills.jsx` (11:57:28 AM):** This component manages a list of recurring bills.  The initial state includes ten sample bills from 'Aceship', all with identical information.  The component features functionality for adding new bills, editing existing ones, deleting bills individually or in bulk, and implementing pagination and search.


**`ManualJournal.jsx` (11:57:44 AM):**  This component handles manual journal entries. The initial state contains fifteen sample entries, all with the same 'Q1' journal and reference, and a status of 'Publish'. This component also provides features for creating, editing, deleting (individual and bulk), and searching journal entries, along with pagination.


**`VendorsCredit.jsx` (11:57:59 AM):** This component manages vendor credits.  It includes functionality to create, edit, and delete (individual and bulk) vendor credits, with search and pagination.  A notable difference is the inclusion of an items array within each credit object, suggesting a more complex structure compared to the other two components. Additionally, this component incorporates a more sophisticated dropdown for deleting rows,  using a `useRef` hook to manage click events outside the dropdown and prevent accidental closure.  The initial state contains two sample entries.


In summary, the changes represent the development of data management interfaces for three distinct financial data types, sharing a similar design philosophy and implementation style.  The timestamps indicate a relatively short period of development, suggesting a potential batch update or a structured approach to component development.
