# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 12:33:16 AM
The log shows development of a Spring Boot application interacting with AI APIs.

Initially (11:35 PM), `OpenAIController.java` was created, handling OpenAI API calls using Spring's AI support.  `AnthropicController.java` was also created but returned a placeholder message indicating key expiration.

Between 11:36 PM and 11:39 PM, the `application.properties` file underwent significant changes.  The initial version contained hardcoded API keys and URLs for OpenAI and Ollama.  These were subsequently replaced with environment variable references (${OPENAI_API_KEY}, ${OLLAMA_BASE_URL}, ${OLLAMA_MODEL}, ${PORT}, ${SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE}) for improved security and portability. An `application-dev.properties` file was also added, containing similar configuration for local development.  The changes to `application.properties` at 11:39:27 PM add the `spring.profiles.active` property to dynamically select profiles.  The final version of application.properties at 11:55 PM shows a simplified version that relies entirely on environment variables.


The `AnthropicController.java` file remained unchanged after its initial creation except for a duplicate entry which was a redundant copy.

Finally (11:46 PM), a `.gitignore` file was added, indicating best practices for managing the projectâ€™s source code using Git, specifically excluding environment files and various temporary files, logs, and IDE specific metadata from version control.
