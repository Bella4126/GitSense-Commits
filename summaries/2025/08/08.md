# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 4:50:06 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `App.jsx` file between 3:53 PM and 3:55 PM on August 8th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: a React application comparing responses from different Large Language Models (LLMs).  The key changes revolve around the models being compared.

Initially, the app compared Google (GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude), and Ollama (Gemma 2).  Subsequent revisions replaced Anthropic with Groq (Claude) and then refined the Groq model name to simply "groq (groq)".  These changes only affect the `models` array within the `App` component, updating the name and, in one instance, the id of the models.  The rest of the component's structure, including the fetching logic (`fetchModelResponse` and `handleSubmit`), the UI rendering, and state management (`useState` hooks for `sharedPrompt`, `responses`, `loading`, and `responseOrder`), remains unchanged across all revisions.  The API endpoint (`http://localhost:8080/api/${model}/${encodedPrompt}`) also remains constant.
