# Activity Summary for 8/4/2025

## 12:10:37 AM
The log shows the evolution of a single Java file, `Hello.java`, over a short period (approximately 30 minutes).  The file's path remains consistent throughout the log. Initially, the file is an empty class.  Between 11:14 PM and 11:16 PM, significant changes occurred, transforming it into a Spring Boot RestController.

The key changes include:

* **11:14:49 PM:** The `@Res` annotation (likely a typo for `@RestController`) is added, suggesting an intention to create a REST controller.
* **11:14:56 PM:**  The correct `@RestController` annotation and an `import` statement for `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController` are added.
* **11:15:19 PM:** A `@RequestMapping` annotation is introduced, initially targeting `/hello`.
* **11:15:37 PM and 11:15:47 PM:** The request mapping is changed to `/` (home page), and there are comments added to the code.
* **11:16:17 PM:** A `hello()` method is added which returns "Hello World!", completing the basic functionality of a simple REST endpoint.


The changes follow a clear pattern: iterative development of a simple Spring Boot REST controller.  The frequent modifications suggest rapid prototyping or debugging.  The comments (e.g., "// HOme page pe ye niche walaunction aaiga ,isnemap krdiah") suggest the developer was working in a language other than English.
