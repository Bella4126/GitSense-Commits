# Activity Summary for 8/9/2025

## 12:10:43 AM
The log shows a development process focused on building a Spring Boot application integrating multiple large language models (LLMs): Google Gemini and OpenAI.  The primary files modified are `GeminiController.java`, `VertexAIConfig.java`, and `OpenAIController.java`.

Initially, `GeminiController.java`  contained basic code to interact with the Gemini model.  Over time, it evolved to include logging, error handling, and  printing project ID and credentials location details for debugging purposes.  The final version uses `@Value` annotations to inject configuration properties for credentials location and project ID from  `application.properties`.

`VertexAIConfig.java` underwent significant changes. The early versions lacked crucial configuration details.  The final version implements a Spring `@Configuration` class that provides a  `VertexAiGeminiChatModel` bean, dynamically loading credentials from either an environment variable (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) or a specified file path. The fallback is set to  "C:/Users/ss/astral-root-468222-q1-fa767822cb7a.json".  The configuration includes  `projectId` and `location` parameters, along with settings for the Gemini model ("gemini-1.5-pro") and temperature (0.7).  Several commits reflect refinement of the `temperature` variable type (from float to double).

`OpenAIController.java` was initially incomplete, undergoing numerous revisions before settling into a functional controller that uses an `OpenAiChatModel` for interacting with the OpenAI API.  The final version uses a `ChatClient` for a more streamlined interaction, handling requests at the endpoint `/api/groq`. The initial attempts at this controller incorrectly used a `GeminiController` constructor and various other typos.  The final version uses the `/api/groq` endpoint and relies on Spring's dependency injection mechanism.

The `application.properties` file was updated to include API keys for OpenAI (Groq) and configuration for Google Vertex AI Gemini. It prioritizes using the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, falling back to a file path for Gemini credentials.  The OpenAI key was changed from an apparently incorrect value to a valid key.

The `Config.java` file (added later) and `ChatClientConfig.java` create `ChatClient.Builder` beans for OpenAI, Ollama, and Gemini, facilitating a more modular and flexible approach. This improved the code by centralizing the configuration of different chat clients. The `GeminiController` and `OpenAIController` were then modified to use the `ChatClient` for a cleaner implementation.

The timestamps show an intense period of development between 11:13 PM and 11:30 PM on August 8th, 2025, followed by further refinement and refactoring on August 9th, 2025.  The renaming of  `GeminiController` to `GroqController` and the creation of `OpenAIController` shows an additional evolution of the project to include multiple models.
