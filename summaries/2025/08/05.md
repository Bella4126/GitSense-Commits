# Activity Summary for 8/5/2025

## 12:30:40 AM
The log shows a series of changes primarily focused on the `ProductService.java` and `Product.java` files within a Spring Boot application.  The majority of changes are within the `ProductService.java` file between 11:31 PM and 11:42 PM on August 4th, 2025, reflecting a refactoring effort.

Initially, `ProductService.java` contained code that directly manipulated an in-memory list of `Product` objects.  This was progressively replaced with calls to a `ProductRepo` which suggests a migration to a database-backed solution.  The `updateProduct` and `deleteProduct` methods were significantly altered, moving from manual list manipulation to using the repository's `save` and `deleteById` methods respectively.  The commented-out sections in later versions of `ProductService.java` further confirm this shift.  The final version of `ProductService.java` (around 11:42 PM) is a clean, concise implementation using the repository for all data access.


The `Product.java` file underwent changes between 11:44 PM and 11:50 PM on August 4th, 2025.  Annotations were added to the `Product` class,  indicating the transition of the `Product` class from a simple POJO to a JPA entity.  Specifically, the `@Entity` annotation marks it as a database entity, and the `@Id` annotation designates `prodId` as the primary key. The `@Component` annotation was removed in the final version.  Finally, a no-argument constructor was added to `Product.java` at 12:02 AM on August 5th, 2025, a requirement for JPA persistence.


The `application.properties` file shows minor modifications (between 11:54 PM and 11:54 PM on August 4th, 2025) adding comments to clarify database configuration, such as the H2 database URL and driver class name. Finally, at 12:05 AM on August 5th, 2025, username and password were added to the `application.properties` file located in the `target/classes` directory, signifying build time configuration.
