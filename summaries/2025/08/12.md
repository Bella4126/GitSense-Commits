# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 3:09:39 PM
The log shows development of a Spring Boot application interacting with AWS S3.  The primary changes revolve around the `application.properties` file, the `S3Service`, and the `S3Controller`.

The `pom.xml` file (2:11:26 PM) defines project dependencies, including Spring Boot starters for web, OAuth2 client, and AWS SDK v2 for S3 and authentication.  Java 17 is specified.

The `application.properties` file undergoes several revisions. Initially (2:19:22 PM), it uses environment variables for AWS credentials and region, specifying a default region (eu-north-1). Later (2:29:15 PM), hardcoded AWS credentials are briefly introduced before reverting back to environment variables with default fallback values (2:49:29 PM) which is a significant change showing emphasis on security. This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information,  showing a focus on security best practices.  The file consistently configures S3 bucket name, server port, file upload size limits, disables Spring Security auto-configuration, and sets logging levels.

The `SimpleS3Config.java` file (2:19:45 PM, 2:27:08 PM, and 2:49:42 PM) configures the S3Client using AWS credentials and region from the `application.properties` file.  A notable change (2:21:40 PM) hardcodes the region to `Region.EU_NORTH_1`, a temporary deviation from using the configurable `awsRegion`.

The `S3service.java` file (multiple timestamps between 2:23:48 PM and 2:50:30 PM) contains the core S3 interaction logic (upload, download, delete, list, and get URL).  The file is initially placed within the `controller` package which is later moved into `service` package. This indicates a restructuring of the project, separating concerns. Several edits focus on error handling and refining the code.  The most significant change is refactoring to improve readability and potentially efficiency. The `@CrossOrigin` annotation is added multiple times then removed finally added to controller class for CORS support.

The `S3Controller.java` file (multiple timestamps between 2:23:48 PM and 2:50:19 PM) defines REST endpoints for S3 operations. The structure of this controller remains consistent with the endpoints for uploading, downloading, deleting, listing files, getting file URLs and a health check.  Similar to `S3service.java`, the `@CrossOrigin` annotation is added in multiple edits for CORS support.

The `.gitignore` file (2:20:05 PM)  lists files and directories to be excluded from Git version control, including compiled code, log files, IDE files, OS-specific files, and crucially, files containing secrets like `.env` files.

In summary, the log shows iterative development with a focus on S3 integration, security improvements (handling sensitive information), and code refactoring to improve organization and clarity.  The use of environment variables for configuration enhances flexibility and security.


## 4:09:35 PM
The log shows development of a Spring Boot application interacting with AWS S3.  `SimpleS3Config.java` remained unchanged after its initial creation at 3:10:56 PM, configuring an S3 client using AWS credentials loaded from application properties.

`S3Controller.java`, created at 3:11:27 PM, provides REST endpoints for uploading, downloading, deleting, listing, and getting URLs of files stored in S3.  It includes a health check endpoint.  The addition of `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")` suggests the need for CORS support.

`S3Service.java`, created at 3:11:43 PM, implements the business logic for interacting with S3, including error handling for various exceptions.  It utilizes the AWS SDK for Java.

The `application.properties` file underwent significant changes.  Initially (3:15:02 PM), it contained hardcoded AWS credentials and S3 bucket information.  Subsequently (3:42:58 PM and again at 4:06:08 PM), it was modified to use environment variables for AWS credentials, region, and bucket name, improving security and deployability.  The server port is also configured to use the environment variable `PORT`, likely for platform compatibility. There was a brief period (4:06:01 PM) where the file was empty, possibly an accidental deletion before reverting to the environment variable configuration.  Throughout the process, the maximum file upload size was consistently set to 10MB.  Spring Security auto-configuration was disabled, and logging levels were configured for debugging and informational purposes.
