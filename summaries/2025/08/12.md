# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 3:09:39 PM
The log shows development of a Spring Boot application interacting with AWS S3.  The primary changes revolve around the `application.properties` file, the `S3Service`, and the `S3Controller`.

The `pom.xml` file (2:11:26 PM) defines project dependencies, including Spring Boot starters for web, OAuth2 client, and AWS SDK v2 for S3 and authentication.  Java 17 is specified.

The `application.properties` file undergoes several revisions. Initially (2:19:22 PM), it uses environment variables for AWS credentials and region, specifying a default region (eu-north-1). Later (2:29:15 PM), hardcoded AWS credentials are briefly introduced before reverting back to environment variables with default fallback values (2:49:29 PM) which is a significant change showing emphasis on security. This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information,  showing a focus on security best practices.  The file consistently configures S3 bucket name, server port, file upload size limits, disables Spring Security auto-configuration, and sets logging levels.

The `SimpleS3Config.java` file (2:19:45 PM, 2:27:08 PM, and 2:49:42 PM) configures the S3Client using AWS credentials and region from the `application.properties` file.  A notable change (2:21:40 PM) hardcodes the region to `Region.EU_NORTH_1`, a temporary deviation from using the configurable `awsRegion`.

The `S3service.java` file (multiple timestamps between 2:23:48 PM and 2:50:30 PM) contains the core S3 interaction logic (upload, download, delete, list, and get URL).  The file is initially placed within the `controller` package which is later moved into `service` package. This indicates a restructuring of the project, separating concerns. Several edits focus on error handling and refining the code.  The most significant change is refactoring to improve readability and potentially efficiency. The `@CrossOrigin` annotation is added multiple times then removed finally added to controller class for CORS support.

The `S3Controller.java` file (multiple timestamps between 2:23:48 PM and 2:50:19 PM) defines REST endpoints for S3 operations. The structure of this controller remains consistent with the endpoints for uploading, downloading, deleting, listing files, getting file URLs and a health check.  Similar to `S3service.java`, the `@CrossOrigin` annotation is added in multiple edits for CORS support.

The `.gitignore` file (2:20:05 PM)  lists files and directories to be excluded from Git version control, including compiled code, log files, IDE files, OS-specific files, and crucially, files containing secrets like `.env` files.

In summary, the log shows iterative development with a focus on S3 integration, security improvements (handling sensitive information), and code refactoring to improve organization and clarity.  The use of environment variables for configuration enhances flexibility and security.
