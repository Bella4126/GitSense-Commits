# Activity Summary for 8/2/2025

## 4:01:30 PM
The `database.go` file underwent numerous revisions related to database connection configuration.  Initially, the database connection string was hardcoded within the `Connect()` function.  Between 3:04 PM and 3:34 PM, several attempts were made to modify this hardcoded string, with variations in password encoding and ultimately resulting in an incomplete or incorrect string.

At 3:41 PM, a significant change occurred. The code was refactored to load the connection string from a `.env` file using the `godotenv` library. This improved security by removing the credentials from the codebase.  The `Connect()` function now includes error handling for `.env` file loading and prints a success message upon successful connection.  The models migrated remain consistent throughout (`User`, `Item`, `Cart`, `Order`).

The `.env` file also saw changes. Initially containing the database connection string, it was commented out at 3:48 PM and then uncommented and modified again at 3:53 PM and 3:57 PM, reflecting changes to the database password. The final password in the `.env` file at 3:57:57 PM is "MyStrongPass123!".  There were a few failed attempts to correctly configure the DSN string, with several commits being reverted or overwritten. The final version of `database.go` at 3:53:44 PM reflects the successful implementation of loading the connection string from the `.env` file.
