# Activity Summary for 9/23/2025

## 7:12:46 AM
The log shows multiple updates to the `application.properties` file between 6:48 AM and 6:55 AM on September 23, 2025.  The primary changes involve the `app.s3.bucket` property, which was initially using environment variables, then changed to the literal value "3", then "Image Uploader", and finally "imager4126".  The AWS secret key was also updated at approximately 6:51 AM. The rest of the configuration (AWS credentials, region, endpoint, server port, multipart sizes, Spring security exclusion, and logging levels) remained consistent throughout these changes.

A single update to `S3Controller.java` occurred at 7:02 AM on September 23, 2025. This update appears to be a minor documentation change within the `uploadFile` method, adding a comment explaining the `MultipartFile` parameter. The functionality of the controller (endpoints for uploading, downloading, deleting, listing, retrieving URLs, and a health check) remained unchanged.
