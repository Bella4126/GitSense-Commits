# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 4:29:45 AM
The `ResultScreen.jsx` component was updated on 9/5/2025, 1:15:17 AM.  This component displays quiz results, including a percentage score, number of correct and incorrect answers, and a performance message. The score influences both the displayed message (Excellent, Good Job, Not Bad, Keep Practicing) and its associated color and background.  The component uses conditional rendering to show different performance badges based on the score achieved (e.g., "Outstanding Performance!" for scores above 80%).  Visually, it employs Tailwind CSS for styling, including animations (`animate-fade-in`, `animate-bounce-subtle`), and SVG icons to represent success or failure.  A button allows the user to restart the quiz.
