# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 4:29:45 AM
The `ResultScreen.jsx` component was updated on 9/5/2025, 1:15:17 AM.  This component displays quiz results, including a percentage score, number of correct and incorrect answers, and a performance message. The score influences both the displayed message (Excellent, Good Job, Not Bad, Keep Practicing) and its associated color and background.  The component uses conditional rendering to show different performance badges based on the score achieved (e.g., "Outstanding Performance!" for scores above 80%).  Visually, it employs Tailwind CSS for styling, including animations (`animate-fade-in`, `animate-bounce-subtle`), and SVG icons to represent success or failure.  A button allows the user to restart the quiz.

The log shows changes primarily focused on `Header.js`, a React component responsible for the website's navigation and user authentication elements.  The `index.html` file remained largely unchanged, serving as a basic React application entry point.

The `Header.js` component underwent several revisions between 2:58:32 PM and 3:00:04 PM.  These revisions appear to be minor cosmetic changes, specifically focusing on the website logo. Initially, the logo was represented by a placeholder image with the file path `/your-logo.png`. This was then changed to `/your-logo.jpg` suggesting a switch in file type for the logo. The content of `Header.js` otherwise remained identical across the multiple commits.

A `.gitignore` file was created at 3:13:19 PM, indicating that version control was set up for the project.  The file was empty in this commit.
