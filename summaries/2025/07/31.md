# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 9:35:37 PM
Between 5:10 PM and 5:15 PM on July 31st, 2025, several React components were updated: `DemoCTA.jsx`, `FAQSection.jsx`, `Navbar.jsx`, `HowItWorks.jsx`, and `Hero.jsx`.  These updates primarily involved styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS, adding interactive elements (like the FAQ accordion), and implementing animations.  The `Navbar.jsx` component was updated twice within a short timeframe, suggesting iterative improvements to its functionality or layout.  The `Hero.jsx` component notably uses a video background and incorporates several animations for floating elements. The `HowItWorks.jsx` component displays a step-by-step process with icons.  The `FeatureCard.jsx` component is a reusable component for displaying features.


At 5:15 PM, the `package-lock.json` file was updated, reflecting changes to the project's dependencies, including updates to various React, Tailwind CSS, and other packages used for styling, form handling, and charting.  This suggests a significant refactoring or dependency update for the project.

Finally, at 9:34 PM, the `.gitignore` file was updated to include several additional patterns to exclude from version control, most notably `.env` files (containing environment variables), build artifacts, and the video file used in the `Hero` component.  This is a standard practice for managing sensitive data and build outputs in a version control system.
