## 1:08:00 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `SideBar.jsx` and `Trade.jsx`, along with a supporting file `page.js` for the `Trade` component.

**`SideBar.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):**  The `SideBar.jsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 12:19 PM and 12:44 PM on May 23, 2025.  These revisions focused on improving the sidebar's user interface.  The initial version was a basic sidebar with navigation items. Subsequent revisions added:

* **A Hamburger Menu:** A hamburger menu was implemented for the collapsed view, replacing the previous close button.
* **Blur Effect:** A blur effect was added to the main content when the sidebar is open, enhancing the user experience.
* **Overlay:** An overlay was added for improved visual clarity when the sidebar is open.
* **"JOIN US" button:**  A "JOIN US" button was added to the bottom section of the collapsed sidebar.
* **Minor UI adjustments:** Several minor UI adjustments were made, including changes to button styling and spacing. The email address displayed in the sidebar was corrected. The z-index for the sidebar was updated to ensure it remained on top of other elements.

**`Trade.jsx` (Two Revisions):** The `Trade.jsx` file was modified twice at 1:06:28 PM and 1:06:40 PM on May 23, 2025, indicating minor changes possibly related to bug fixes or very small UI updates. The main content of this file is a React component that renders a candlestick chart.  No significant changes are apparent in the code snippets provided.  The component includes functionality for selecting currency pairs, timeframes and investment amount.  It also incorporates candlestick chart data, functions for drawing and rendering the chart, and handling hover interactions to provide detailed tooltip information upon hovering over the candles.


**`page.js`:** This file, modified at 1:07:45 PM on May 23, 2025, simply imports and renders the `Trade` component, serving as a wrapper for it.  No substantial changes are noted.


## 2:07:59 PM
The log shows code modifications on May 23, 2025, primarily focused on the development of a tournament feature within a React application.

**`c:\Users\ss\Quotex_frontend\app\MainLayout\page.js` (1:08:43 PM):** This file is the main layout component.  The update shows a simple structure including a `MainLayout` component and a `Trade` component. A commented-out `Completed` component suggests that functionality might be added later.

**`c:\Users\ss\Quotex_frontend\app\MainLayout\SideBar.jsx` (1:29:05 PM):**  This file underwent significant changes.  The initial version was fully commented out. The final version implemented a sidebar component with navigation items ("TRADE," "SUPPORT," "ACCOUNT," "TOURNA-MENTS," "MARKET," "MORE"), user account details, deposit/withdrawal links, and settings/volume controls.  The sidebar is designed to be collapsible, adding a blur effect to the main content when expanded. The change introduced a more user-friendly collapsible sidebar with improved UI and functionality.  Note the corrected email address in the final version.  A "JOIN US" link was also added in the final revision.


**`c:\Users\ss\Quotex_frontend\app\Tournament\Active.jsx` (1:30:34 PM):** This file displays active and completed tournaments.  It features a tabbed interface to switch between "ACTIVE" and "COMPLETED" tournaments.  Each tournament is represented by a card showing the name, prize pool, entry fee, number of participants, duration, and a "Details" button.  The implementation is detailed, indicating well-defined styling and structure.  Multiple tournaments ("Crazy Wednesday," "Free Friday," "Weekend Battle") with different parameters are hardcoded.

**`c:\Users\ss\Quotex_frontend\app\Tournament\page.js` (1:32:24 PM and 1:33:19 PM):**  This file acts as the entry point for the tournament page.  Initially, it only rendered the `Active` component. It was subsequently updated to wrap the `Active` component within the `MainLayout` component at 1:33:19 PM, integrating the tournament section into the main application layout.  This indicates a final integration step.
