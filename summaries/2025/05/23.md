* **Blur Effect:** A blur effect was added to the main content when the sidebar is open, enhancing the user experience.
* **Overlay:** An overlay was added for improved visual clarity when the sidebar is open.
* **"JOIN US" button:**  A "JOIN US" button was added to the bottom section of the collapsed sidebar.
* **Minor UI adjustments:** Several minor UI adjustments were made, including changes to button styling and spacing. The email address displayed in the sidebar was corrected. The z-index for the sidebar was updated to ensure it remained on top of other elements.

**`Trade.jsx` (Two Revisions):** The `Trade.jsx` file was modified twice at 1:06:28 PM and 1:06:40 PM on May 23, 2025, indicating minor changes possibly related to bug fixes or very small UI updates. The main content of this file is a React component that renders a candlestick chart.  No significant changes are apparent in the code snippets provided.  The component includes functionality for selecting currency pairs, timeframes and investment amount.  It also incorporates candlestick chart data, functions for drawing and rendering the chart, and handling hover interactions to provide detailed tooltip information upon hovering over the candles.


**`page.js`:** This file, modified at 1:07:45 PM on May 23, 2025, simply imports and renders the `Trade` component, serving as a wrapper for it.  No substantial changes are noted.
