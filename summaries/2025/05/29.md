# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 3:10:56 PM
The log shows several code changes across two files: `FAQSection.jsx` and `Footer.jsx`.  Both files underwent multiple revisions within a short time frame (between approximately 2:18 PM and 2:49 PM for `FAQSection.jsx`, and between 2:25 PM and 2:47 PM for `Footer.jsx`).  The changes primarily involve styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS classes, and the addition/removal of animation features (`transition-all`, `duration-200`, `duration-300`, `ease-in-out`, `max-h-96`, `opacity-100`, `max-h-0`, `opacity-0`).  There's also a pattern of commented-out code sections, suggesting iterative development and experimentation.

Specifically in `FAQSection.jsx`:  The initial version was a basic FAQ component.  Later versions refined the styling, adding hover effects and accordion-style animations for expanding and collapsing FAQ answers. A "contact support" section was added and later removed.

In `Footer.jsx`:  The major changes involved restructuring the layout using Tailwind CSS classes for improved responsiveness (using `sm:` and `lg:` prefixes for different screen sizes).  The icon sizes were also adjusted, and further refinements were made to spacing and visual elements.  The final version likely represents a more polished and responsive footer design.  The Footer consistently includes legal information, social media links, and various links to different sections of the website.


The `Authlayout.jsx` file shows a significant change between its first and second versions. The first version is a basic authentication layout, while the second version contains a fully functional registration component.  This component includes features like form validation for inputs, password strength indicators, a country selector, and an OTP verification step.  The second version uses various `lucide-react` icons and handles form data using React's useState hook. The component renders an OTP verification modal upon form submission and redirects to the login page after successful verification. The countries data is embedded within the code itself, which consists of an extensive list of countries.
