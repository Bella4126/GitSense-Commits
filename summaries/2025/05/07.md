# Activity Summary for 5/7/2025

## 1:40:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `RecurringBills.jsx` component between 12:50 AM and 12:57 AM on May 7, 2025.  The component displays a table of recurring bills,  allowing for creation, editing, deletion of individual bills and  bulk deletion of selected bills. The data is paginated with 10 rows per page. A search functionality is also implemented allowing filtering by vendor name, profile name, and status.  There is a dark mode toggle (though the code for this is commented out in the provided snippets).

No significant code changes are observed across the revisions; the code remains functionally identical in each version. The initial state for `bills` array consists of ten identical entries for 'Aceship'.  The timestamps suggest minor adjustments or possible autosaves were made during this period.
