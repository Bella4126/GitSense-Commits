# Activity Summary for 5/31/2025

## 12:30:48 AM
The log shows significant development activity on the Quotex frontend between May 30th and 31st, 2025.  Several key components were updated:

**Trade.jsx:** This file, updated at 11:36:06 PM on May 30th, is a React component responsible for displaying a trading interface.  It fetches asset data and candlestick chart data from a backend API (using `/api/v1/assets/getAssets` and `/api/v1/candles/getCandles`).  It establishes a WebSocket connection (`WS_URL`) for real-time chart updates.  The core functionality involves rendering a candlestick chart with interactive elements like hover information and indicators for trade start and end times. The chart drawing logic is extensive, managing scaling, grid lines, candlestick rendering, and hover effects.


**About.jsx:** Updated at 11:40:44 PM on May 30th, this component displays an "About Us" page with sections for company overview, key statistics, mission, vision, core values, and the leadership team. It features a consistent design pattern using Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout.


**Blog.jsx:** Modified at 11:41:07 PM on May 30th, this component renders a blog page. It includes functionality for searching and filtering blog posts by category and keyword.  The posts are displayed in a grid layout, highlighting featured and regular posts.


**Affiliate.jsx:** Updated at 11:41:33 PM on May 30th, this component displays an affiliate program page with tabs for overview, commission structure, benefits, marketing materials, and FAQs.  It uses a similar design pattern to About.jsx.  It includes a feature to copy an affiliate link to the clipboard.


**About.js, Affiliate.js, Blog.js:** These files, updated between 11:42:07 PM and 11:44:27 PM on May 30th, act as simple wrappers, exporting their respective components (`About`, `Affiliate`, `Blog`) as default exports.  These demonstrate a consistent folder structure for pages.


**Footer.jsx:** This component underwent several revisions on May 31st, specifically at 12:06:40 AM, 12:09:01 AM, and 12:12:20 AM.  The primary change was the addition of a "Have Questions?" link directing to an inquiry form.  The component is a reusable footer displaying links for help, about us, more resources, social media icons, app store badges, copyright information, and legal disclaimers.  The structure and styling are consistent throughout the revisions.


**Enquiry.jsx:**  This component, updated at 12:11:53 AM, 12:20:51 AM, and 12:22:21 AM on May 31st, creates an inquiry form with input fields for email and query.  The most substantial changes involve adding a success popup and enhancing styling using Tailwind CSS classes.


**Enquiry.js:** This file, updated at 12:13:18 AM on May 31st, simply exports the `Enquiry` component.


**Navbar.jsx:**  This file, updated at 12:23:15 AM on May 31st, shows a progressive refinement of the navigation bar.  The most significant revision involved updating the styling and applying a more advanced visual design using gradients and shadows.  Links to different pages are added and the structure is cleaned up.


**About.js (multiple updates):** This page received several updates on May 31st which included integrating the `Navbar` and `Footer` components to create a more complete page structure.


The overall pattern reveals a consistent use of React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons.  The development process appears iterative, with multiple refinements to components and progressive enhancement of user interface elements.  The majority of the significant changes were made within a short timeframe on May 30th, suggesting a potential sprint or release cycle.
