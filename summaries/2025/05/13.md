The README file was updated on May 13, 2025, at 2:05:44 PM.  The update provides instructions for setting up both the frontend and backend of a task management system.  It details installation using `npm install` for both parts,  and configuring `.env` files with API URLs, MongoDB URIs, JWT secrets, and port numbers.  The instructions also include a live link to the deployed application.  Note that specific environment variable values (like the actual JWT secret) are redacted for security.

The log shows several updates to React components for a credit note management system.  The main changes center around `TableData.jsx`, `Pagination.jsx`, and `CreditLayout.jsx`.

**`TableData.jsx`**: This component, which displays a table of credit notes, underwent two revisions. The first (3:28:29 PM) established the core table functionality, including adding new entries, deleting selected entries, pagination, and row selection. The second revision (3:33:14 PM) added `w-full h-full` to the outer `div`'s className,  likely to ensure the table component fills its parent container completely.  No functional changes were made to the table's core logic.

**`Pagination.jsx`**: This component, responsible for pagination in the credit notes table, was created at 3:28:52 PM.  It provides "Previous" and "Next" buttons and page number selection, dynamically adjusting display based on the current page and total pages.

**`CreditLayout.jsx`**: This component acts as a wrapper for the `DataProvider` and `DataTable` components. It experienced a minor styling change between its creation at 3:29:05 PM and a later update at 3:32:18 PM. The initial version used `flex flex-col h-full w-full` for styling, suggesting a change from a different layout to a full-height, full-width column layout.

**Overall Pattern**: The changes suggest a focused development effort on improving the user interface and layout of the credit notes management system.  The timestamps indicate a rapid iteration cycle, with multiple updates within a short timeframe. There is no evidence of any significant logic changes within any of the components.
