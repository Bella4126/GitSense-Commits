# Activity Summary for 5/13/2025

## 2:37:52 PM
The README file was updated on May 13, 2025, at 2:05:44 PM.  The update provides instructions for setting up both the frontend and backend of a task management system.  It details installation using `npm install` for both parts,  and configuring `.env` files with API URLs, MongoDB URIs, JWT secrets, and port numbers.  The instructions also include a live link to the deployed application.  Note that specific environment variable values (like the actual JWT secret) are redacted for security.
