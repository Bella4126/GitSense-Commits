# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 11:04:17 AM
The log shows significant development on a React frontend application, specifically focusing on the login (`SignIn.jsx`) and main layout (`MainLayout.jsx`) components, and a sidebar component (`SideBar.jsx`).

**`MainLayout.jsx`**: This file, defining the main application layout, underwent minor updates throughout the log.  The initial version (9:12:38 PM) established a basic layout with a navbar and sidebar using Tailwind CSS. Subsequent changes (9:18:57 PM, 9:20:01 PM, 10:34:55 PM) seem to be mostly formatting or very minor structural adjustments; the core functionality remained consistent.  The final version adds  `'use client';` directive indicating it's a client component in Next.js.

**`SignIn.jsx`**: This component experienced substantial changes over time. It started (9:15:11 PM) as a commented-out login/registration form with a basic UI.  Multiple revisions followed (9:15:23 PM, 9:17:05 PM, 9:22:08 PM, 9:25:02 PM, 9:26:33 PM, 9:41:37 PM, 9:42:53 PM, 9:43:32 PM), progressively adding functionality and refining the UI.  The most notable changes involved:

*   Adding a tabbed interface for login and registration.
*   Implementing handlers (`handleSignIn`, `handleRegistration`) using `useRouter` from `next/navigation` to navigate to `/MainLayout` upon successful login or registration.  This implies the introduction of client-side routing.
*   Adding form elements for email, password, and a "remember me" checkbox.
*   Incorporating social login buttons.
*   The `form` tag was added to the login section (around 9:17:05 PM).
*   A link to `/MainLayout` was repeatedly added and removed within the form. The final version appears to use a `Link` component from Next.js to wrap the submit button, redirecting to the main layout upon successful submission.


**`SideBar.jsx`**: This file (initially appearing at 9:20:17 PM) defines a collapsible sidebar with navigation items.  A significant update (5/20/2025, 10:40:01 AM) added:

*   An overlay effect to dim the background when the sidebar is open.
*   A hamburger menu icon for the collapsed state.
*   A "JOIN US" button is added to the bottom items in collapsed state.
*   A blur effect applied to the main content (`#main-content`) when the sidebar is open.
*   The email address `jsingh.nikhil@webseeder.tech` is displayed when the sidebar is open.


**`page.js` (in `app/Login` and `app/MainLayout` folders)**: These files act as page components for the login and main dashboard respectively.  The login page uses an `AuthLayout` component (not shown in the log) to wrap the `SignIn` component. The main layout page renders a simple "Trading Dashboard" title and placeholder content.  The `page.js` file in `MainLayout` directory went through several minor revisions (10:27:26 PM onwards), with the main change being correction of the default export function name. The final version uses `'use client'` indicating it is a client-side component.

**Recurring Elements**: The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is evident throughout the code.  Several changes show a pattern of iterative development, with features being added and refined across multiple commits. The heavy use of JSX and React Hooks is consistent with a React application.  The frequent edits to `SignIn.jsx` suggest this component was a primary focus of development.


## 2:50:24 PM
The log shows development of a React application, specifically focusing on a "Tournaments" feature.  The `MainLayout\page.js` file underwent multiple revisions to correctly import and render the `Active` component, which displays active tournaments.  Initially, there were issues with the import path.  The correct import path `'@/components/Tournament/Active'` was established by 1:58:54 PM.


The `components\Tournament\Active.jsx` file, representing the active tournament display, was created and subsequently updated (minor changes, likely stylistic). This component displays a list of tournaments with details like name, prize pool, entry fee, number of participants, duration, and a "Details" button.  The UI utilizes a tab system for "ACTIVE" and "COMPLETED" tournaments.  The initial version of this component was created around 1:54:01 PM.  The changes between 1:54:01 PM and 1:58:20 PM seem minimal - possibly just a rename from `Tournaments` to `Active`.


## 3:50:27 PM
The log shows a series of code changes across two React components, `Active.jsx` and `Completed.jsx`, both located within the `Quotex_frontend\components\Tournament` directory, and a main layout file `page.js`.  The changes primarily involve the implementation and modification of a tournament display, showing both active and completed tournaments.

Initially, `Completed.jsx` (5/20/2025, 3:04:30 PM) displays completed tournaments with a simple design.  A subsequent update (5/20/2025, 3:05:13 PM) to `Completed.jsx` doesn't appear to alter the functionality or structure of the code.

`Active.jsx` (5/20/2025, 3:09:40 PM) is introduced, displaying active tournaments and including a link to the `Completed` component.  There are several subsequent revisions to `Active.jsx` (5/20/2025, 3:15:56 PM, 5/20/2025, 3:19:27 PM) that seemingly comment out the entire component. These were likely intermediate steps in refactoring. At  5/20/2025, 3:40:56 PM, `Active.jsx` was reverted to a version similar to the initial version, with the "Completed" tab being a button instead of a link.

The `Completed.jsx` component undergoes significant revisions between 5/20/2025, 3:21:23 PM and 5/20/2025, 3:24:30 PM.  These changes focus on the structure of the displayed tournament information (specifically the addition of a fourth tournament card in one revision), and the navigation links between the `Active` and `Completed` components. The links are initially to `/Completed` and `/`,  but later updated to `/Active` and `/`.

Finally, the `MainLayout\page.js` file (5/20/2025, 3:25:06 PM - 5/20/2025, 3:25:48 PM) shows changes in which components (`Active` and `Completed`) are rendered.  The final version at 3:25:48 PM renders only the `Active` component.

Throughout the logs, a consistent design pattern is visible, using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  The components repeatedly use similar structures for displaying tournament cards, with sections for timers, names, prize pools, entry fees, participant numbers, duration, and details buttons.  The repeated commenting out and uncommenting of large sections of code in `Active.jsx` suggests an iterative development process with frequent refactoring.
