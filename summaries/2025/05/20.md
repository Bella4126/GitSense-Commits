# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 11:04:17 AM
The log shows significant development on a React frontend application, specifically focusing on the login (`SignIn.jsx`) and main layout (`MainLayout.jsx`) components, and a sidebar component (`SideBar.jsx`).

**`MainLayout.jsx`**: This file, defining the main application layout, underwent minor updates throughout the log.  The initial version (9:12:38 PM) established a basic layout with a navbar and sidebar using Tailwind CSS. Subsequent changes (9:18:57 PM, 9:20:01 PM, 10:34:55 PM) seem to be mostly formatting or very minor structural adjustments; the core functionality remained consistent.  The final version adds  `'use client';` directive indicating it's a client component in Next.js.

**`SignIn.jsx`**: This component experienced substantial changes over time. It started (9:15:11 PM) as a commented-out login/registration form with a basic UI.  Multiple revisions followed (9:15:23 PM, 9:17:05 PM, 9:22:08 PM, 9:25:02 PM, 9:26:33 PM, 9:41:37 PM, 9:42:53 PM, 9:43:32 PM), progressively adding functionality and refining the UI.  The most notable changes involved:

*   Adding a tabbed interface for login and registration.
*   Implementing handlers (`handleSignIn`, `handleRegistration`) using `useRouter` from `next/navigation` to navigate to `/MainLayout` upon successful login or registration.  This implies the introduction of client-side routing.
*   Adding form elements for email, password, and a "remember me" checkbox.
*   Incorporating social login buttons.
*   The `form` tag was added to the login section (around 9:17:05 PM).
*   A link to `/MainLayout` was repeatedly added and removed within the form. The final version appears to use a `Link` component from Next.js to wrap the submit button, redirecting to the main layout upon successful submission.


**`SideBar.jsx`**: This file (initially appearing at 9:20:17 PM) defines a collapsible sidebar with navigation items.  A significant update (5/20/2025, 10:40:01 AM) added:

*   An overlay effect to dim the background when the sidebar is open.
*   A hamburger menu icon for the collapsed state.
*   A "JOIN US" button is added to the bottom items in collapsed state.
*   A blur effect applied to the main content (`#main-content`) when the sidebar is open.
*   The email address `jsingh.nikhil@webseeder.tech` is displayed when the sidebar is open.


**`page.js` (in `app/Login` and `app/MainLayout` folders)**: These files act as page components for the login and main dashboard respectively.  The login page uses an `AuthLayout` component (not shown in the log) to wrap the `SignIn` component. The main layout page renders a simple "Trading Dashboard" title and placeholder content.  The `page.js` file in `MainLayout` directory went through several minor revisions (10:27:26 PM onwards), with the main change being correction of the default export function name. The final version uses `'use client'` indicating it is a client-side component.

**Recurring Elements**: The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is evident throughout the code.  Several changes show a pattern of iterative development, with features being added and refined across multiple commits. The heavy use of JSX and React Hooks is consistent with a React application.  The frequent edits to `SignIn.jsx` suggest this component was a primary focus of development.


## 2:50:24 PM
The log shows development of a React application, specifically focusing on a "Tournaments" feature.  The `MainLayout\page.js` file underwent multiple revisions to correctly import and render the `Active` component, which displays active tournaments.  Initially, there were issues with the import path.  The correct import path `'@/components/Tournament/Active'` was established by 1:58:54 PM.


The `components\Tournament\Active.jsx` file, representing the active tournament display, was created and subsequently updated (minor changes, likely stylistic). This component displays a list of tournaments with details like name, prize pool, entry fee, number of participants, duration, and a "Details" button.  The UI utilizes a tab system for "ACTIVE" and "COMPLETED" tournaments.  The initial version of this component was created around 1:54:01 PM.  The changes between 1:54:01 PM and 1:58:20 PM seem minimal - possibly just a rename from `Tournaments` to `Active`.
