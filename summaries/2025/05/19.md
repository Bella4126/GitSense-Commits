# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 10:29:05 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\ss\Quotex_frontend\app\page.js` on May 19, 2025, at 9:31:46 AM.  This change involves updating the main page component (`Home`) to render several React components: `Navbar`, `Hero`, `FeaturesSection`, `AdditionalFeatures`, `DemoCTA`, and `HowItWorks`.  Commented-out code suggests that `FAQSection` and `Footer` components were previously present or are planned for future inclusion. The main page uses a dark background gradient (`bg-gradient-to-b from-[#1a2235] to-[#111827]`). The update primarily focuses on structuring the page layout and importing necessary components.
