# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 1:02:39 PM
The file `c:\Users\ss\Inventory_frontend\src\components\itemGroups\ItemsGropusTable.jsx` underwent two revisions on May 12th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: rendering a table of item groups with pagination, sorting, and selection features.  Both versions included  handling for adding new items (`onAddNew`), editing items (`onEdit`), deleting single items (`onDelete`), and deleting selected items (`onDeleteSelected`).

The first revision (12:59:27 PM) presented a table with a more complex styling using `<div>` and `<table>` elements,  involving classes like `bg-white`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow`, and others for visual presentation. It used React Icons for actions. The header section had two versions, one commented out, suggesting a design iteration.

The second revision (1:01:35 PM) simplified the table's structure, removing nested `<div>` elements within the table and utilizing a simpler styling approach.  The substantial difference lies in the table's presentation;  the overall structure and functionality of the component were preserved.  The commented-out header section from the first revision was removed. The outer div changed from `bg-white rounded-lg shadow overflow-hidden` to `p-6 flex-1 overflow-auto`.  This suggests a refactoring effort focused on improving the UI's structure and potentially improving readability or responsiveness.  No changes were made to the underlying logic for sorting, pagination, or data handling.


## 2:02:41 PM
The log shows updates to two files within the `Inventory_frontend` React application: `ItemGroupsLayout.jsx` and `ItemGropsForm.jsx`.  There are also multiple, rapid changes to `ItemGropsForm.jsx` between 1:13 PM and 1:18 PM on May 12, 2025, suggesting iterative development or debugging of this component.  The content of these changes in `ItemGropsForm.jsx` appears to be mostly commenting and uncommenting of existing code, rather than significant structural alterations.  No substantial code changes are present in these commits.

**`c:\Users\ss\Inventory_frontend\src\components\itemGroups\ItemGroupsLayout.jsx` (5/12/2025, 1:04:01 PM):** This commit modifies the `ItemGroupLayout` component's rendering logic. The original JSX was heavily commented out and replaced with a new structure using a conditional rendering (`{!isFormOpen ? ... : ...}`) to display either an `ItemTable` or an `ItemForm` component based on the `isFormOpen` state. This improves the UI by only showing the relevant component at a time and also simplifies the structure of the returned component.  The changes also altered the layout to `flex-1 overflow-auto w-full h-full` instead of the commented-out layout.

**`c:\Users\ss\Inventory_frontend\src\components\itemGroups\ItemGropsForm.jsx` (Multiple commits between 5/12/2025, 1:13:50 PM and 5/12/2025, 1:18:05 PM):** This file undergoes several commits, all appearing to involve commenting/uncommenting large sections of code. This suggests potential experimentation, debugging, or temporary code removal, without any substantial functional change across the multiple commits. The component remains largely unchanged in its structure and functionality during this period.

**`c:\Users\ss\Inventory_frontend\src\components\shipments\Shipments.jsx` (5/12/2025, 1:31:06 PM):** This commit introduces a `ShipmentTable` component that displays and manages shipment data.  Key features include:

*   CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for shipments.
*   Pagination with adjustable page size.
*   Filtering of shipments based on notes (e.g., "Handle with care").
*   Bulk delete functionality.
*   Use of `lucide-react` icons for UI elements.
*   The component manages state for form data, edit mode, page navigation, selected rows, and filtering.  Dummy data is used for initial population of shipments.
