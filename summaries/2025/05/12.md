# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 1:02:39 PM
The file `c:\Users\ss\Inventory_frontend\src\components\itemGroups\ItemsGropusTable.jsx` underwent two revisions on May 12th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: rendering a table of item groups with pagination, sorting, and selection features.  Both versions included  handling for adding new items (`onAddNew`), editing items (`onEdit`), deleting single items (`onDelete`), and deleting selected items (`onDeleteSelected`).

The first revision (12:59:27 PM) presented a table with a more complex styling using `<div>` and `<table>` elements,  involving classes like `bg-white`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow`, and others for visual presentation. It used React Icons for actions. The header section had two versions, one commented out, suggesting a design iteration.

The second revision (1:01:35 PM) simplified the table's structure, removing nested `<div>` elements within the table and utilizing a simpler styling approach.  The substantial difference lies in the table's presentation;  the overall structure and functionality of the component were preserved.  The commented-out header section from the first revision was removed. The outer div changed from `bg-white rounded-lg shadow overflow-hidden` to `p-6 flex-1 overflow-auto`.  This suggests a refactoring effort focused on improving the UI's structure and potentially improving readability or responsiveness.  No changes were made to the underlying logic for sorting, pagination, or data handling.
