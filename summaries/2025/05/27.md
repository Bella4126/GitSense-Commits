The log shows multiple edits to a Groovy file named "B_Gorilla_and_the_Exam.groovy".  The code itself remains unchanged across all edits to this file.  The file was edited multiple times between 11:29 PM and 11:30 PM on May 26, 2025. The edits involved moving the file between two different locations:  `c:\Users\ss\` and `c:\Users\ss\OneDrive\Desktop\`. There is also an empty file named "Untitled-1" that was created at 11:28:49 PM.  The core functionality of the Groovy code appears to solve a problem involving minimizing operations to make all values in an array the same, given a constraint on the maximum number of allowed changes.
