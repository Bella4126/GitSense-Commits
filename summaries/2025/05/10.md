# Activity Summary for 5/10/2025

## 1:26:30 PM
On May 10, 2025, at 1:18:14 PM, the `PurchaseOrderForm.jsx` component was updated.  This component, seemingly for creating purchase orders (invoices), underwent significant changes.  The update introduced a fully functional form with features including:

* **Dynamic Invoice Number Generation:**  Invoice numbers are automatically generated using `INV-${String(Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000)).substring(0, 6)}`, ensuring uniqueness.  There's also a button to regenerate the number.

* **Line Item Management:** The form allows for adding, removing, and modifying multiple line items, each with description, quantity, rate, and calculated amount fields. Bulk addition of two rows is also supported.  Calculations are done client-side to update amounts dynamically.

* **Date Selection:**  Invoice and due dates are handled with date input fields.  The due date defaults to 30 days from the invoice date.

* **Customer and Salesperson Selection:** Dropdowns provide options for selecting customers and salespeople.  The lists of customers and salespeople (`customers` and `salespeople` arrays) are hardcoded within the component.

* **File Upload:** Allows for attaching a file (indicated by `selectedFile` state).

* **Adjustment Field:** An adjustment field allows for adding or subtracting from the total amount.

* **Currency Selection:** A dropdown for selecting currency (INR, USD, EUR, GBP).

* **Terms Selection:** A dropdown for choosing invoice terms (Due on receipt, Net 15, Net 30, Net 45, Net 60).

* **Save and Save & New Functionality:** Buttons to save the invoice and to save and create a new invoice.

* **Dark Mode Support:** The UI adapts to dark mode based on a `darkMode` prop, changing background and text colors.

The component uses React's useState and useRef hooks for managing state and references.  The code is well-structured and makes use of Tailwind CSS for styling.  The overall update represents a substantial addition or revision of the invoice creation functionality within the application.
