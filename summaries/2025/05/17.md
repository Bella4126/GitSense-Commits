# Activity Summary for 5/17/2025

## 9:50:10 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `c:\Users\ss\Quotex_frontend\app\page.js` file between 6:13 PM and 6:15 PM on May 17, 2025.  The changes consistently involve commenting out sections of the React component responsible for rendering the page.

Initially, the file contained all components (`Navbar`, `Hero`, `FeaturesSection`, `AdditionalFeatures`, `DemoCTA`, `HowItWorks`, `FAQSection`, `Footer`).  Subsequent edits progressively commented out components, starting with `AdditionalFeatures`, `DemoCTA`, `HowItWorks`, `FAQSection`, and `Footer` at 6:13:23 PM.  Further modifications continued this pattern, ultimately leaving only `Navbar`, `Hero`, `FeaturesSection`, and `AdditionalFeatures` uncommented by 6:15:51 PM.  The changes suggest a process of iterative removal or disabling of components from the page's rendering.  The commenting style suggests a deliberate process of testing and debugging or perhaps simplifying the page for a specific purpose.
