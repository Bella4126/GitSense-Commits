# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 2:23:48 PM
The log shows significant updates to two files: `Items.jsx` and `ItemTable.jsx` within the `Inventory_frontend` React application.

`Items.jsx`: This component, related to item management, underwent multiple revisions on May 14, 2025.  Early revisions (11:12:50 AM and 11:13:09 AM) focused on creating a form for adding new items.  The form handles various input fields (name, SKU, unit, dimensions, weight, manufacturer, brand, etc.), image uploads, and nested object updates.  Later revisions (11:35:34 AM and 11:35:49 AM) appear to be reverted back to commented-out code, suggesting experimentation or a rollback to a previous version.  The component uses the `lucide-react` library for icons.

`ItemTable.jsx`:  This component displays a table of inventory items. The initial version (11:13:38 AM) was commented out, suggesting it was under development or temporarily disabled.  A substantial rewrite occurred at 11:32:11 AM and 11:32:25 AM.  These revisions introduced functionality for searching, sorting (including sorting by nested `salesInfo.price`), pagination, selection (single and multiple items), adding new items, editing existing items, and deleting items (single and bulk).  The component incorporates sample data for demonstration, and it also adds a status field ('AVAILABLE', 'LOW STOCK', 'OUT OF STOCK') for items. The final version (11:39:54 AM) removes the dynamic sorting and fixes the sorting field to `name` only.


A recurring pattern is the extensive use of functional components and state management with `useState` hooks in React.  The code consistently employs a functional style, with many small helper functions for handling form inputs and state updates.  The UI seems to be built using a Tailwind CSS-like styling framework.
