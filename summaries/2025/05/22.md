# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 11:44:27 AM
The log shows several code modifications within the `Quotex_frontend` application on May 22nd, 2025.

The `Account.jsx` file (11:24:40 AM) received a major update, introducing a comprehensive user account interface.  This interface includes navigation tabs (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transactions, etc.), currency information display, personal data input fields (with email verification), a security section (two-step verification), password change functionality, document verification status, and settings for language and timezone selection.  The UI utilizes a dark theme and is built with React and Lucide React icons.

Subsequently, the `page.js` file in the `Account` directory underwent two minor revisions (11:25:48 AM and 11:26:11 AM).  These changes corrected the import path for the `Account` component, switching from a relative path (`@/components/Account/Account`) to a simpler relative path (`./Account`). This suggests a restructuring of the project's component directory.

A significant change occurred in the `SideBar.jsx` file (11:27:39 AM).  The code initially presented a commented-out sidebar component,  then this commented-out code was replaced with a new version. The new sidebar includes a toggleable hamburger menu, an overlay for improved user experience, and links to various sections of the application.  It also features a user email and links to Deposit and Withdrawal sections.

Finally, another minor adjustment was made to `page.js` within the `Account` directory (11:28:25 AM). The import path for `MainLayout` was updated to reflect a change in its location within the project directory structure.  This change is consistent with the earlier changes that reorganized the directory structure.  Overall, the changes show a focused effort on improving the user interface and restructuring the project's codebase.
