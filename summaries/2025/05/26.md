# Activity Summary for 5/26/2025

## 4:03:03 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `SideBar.jsx` between 12:13 AM and 1:01 AM on May 26, 2025.  A `NavItem.jsx` file was also updated at 12:28 AM.

The `NavItem.jsx` file update at 12:28 AM appears to be a minor change, focused on styling and conditional rendering of navigation items based on properties like `isOpen`, `active`, and `multiline`, enabling multiline labels for better visual presentation of some menu items.


The `SideBar.jsx` file underwent several revisions.  The initial version (12:13 AM) contained a fully functional side bar component with a support panel featuring FAQ, tutorials, and account/verification related questions.  The support panel was well structured and used a nested object structure (`supportData`) to organize help content.  The component also included custom SVG icons and handled sidebar opening/closing, and blurring of main content.

Subsequent commits (12:29 AM, 12:39 AM, 12:41 AM, 12:41:45 AM, 12:47 AM, 12:52 AM, 12:52:52 AM, and 1:01 AM)  all resulted in the complete removal of the code in `SideBar.jsx`, suggesting a potential rollback or significant restructuring of the component.  The commented-out code in these later revisions is identical to the original version from 12:13 AM, indicating the entire component was temporarily removed and then later commented out in subsequent commits.  This pattern implies a potential debugging or refactoring process, where the component's functionality was removed before likely being reinstated (not shown in the given log).
