# Activity Summary for 5/26/2025

## 4:03:03 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `SideBar.jsx` between 12:13 AM and 1:01 AM on May 26, 2025.  A `NavItem.jsx` file was also updated at 12:28 AM.

The `NavItem.jsx` file update at 12:28 AM appears to be a minor change, focused on styling and conditional rendering of navigation items based on properties like `isOpen`, `active`, and `multiline`, enabling multiline labels for better visual presentation of some menu items.


The `SideBar.jsx` file underwent several revisions.  The initial version (12:13 AM) contained a fully functional side bar component with a support panel featuring FAQ, tutorials, and account/verification related questions.  The support panel was well structured and used a nested object structure (`supportData`) to organize help content.  The component also included custom SVG icons and handled sidebar opening/closing, and blurring of main content.

Subsequent commits (12:29 AM, 12:39 AM, 12:41 AM, 12:41:45 AM, 12:47 AM, 12:52 AM, 12:52:52 AM, and 1:01 AM)  all resulted in the complete removal of the code in `SideBar.jsx`, suggesting a potential rollback or significant restructuring of the component.  The commented-out code in these later revisions is identical to the original version from 12:13 AM, indicating the entire component was temporarily removed and then later commented out in subsequent commits.  This pattern implies a potential debugging or refactoring process, where the component's functionality was removed before likely being reinstated (not shown in the given log).


## 5:29:07 PM
The log shows updates to several React components between 2:43 PM and 5:11 PM on May 26, 2025.

**SideBar.jsx (5/26/2025, 2:43:53 PM):** This component was significantly updated.  The changes introduce a complex sidebar with interactive elements including support panels ('Help', 'Tutorials', 'FAQ' sections with nested questions), a leaderboard (`leaderboardData`), and signals (`signalsData`, `pastSignalsData`).  The component uses `useState` extensively to manage various UI states (e.g., panel visibility, hover states).  A `renderNavItem` function was updated for consistent hover behavior, and `renderUserProfileCard` displays user profile information from the leaderboard data.  The component utilizes the `lucide-react` icon library and `next/navigation` for routing.  Significant effort was dedicated to creating a dynamic and interactive sidebar with numerous features.

**Transaction.jsx (5/26/2025, 4:44:57 PM):** This component displays a transaction history with filtering and sorting capabilities.  It uses sample transaction data (`transactions`) and renders it in a table format. Icons from `lucide-react` indicate transaction type and status.  The UI includes navigation tabs for different sections (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transactions, Trades, Account, Market, Tournaments, Analytics), currency information, and filters for transaction type and date range.  The component also calculates and displays transaction summaries (total deposits, withdrawals, and pending transactions).

**page.js (5/26/2025, 4:45:33 PM):** This file is a simple page component that renders the `Transaction` component within a `MainLayout`.  This suggests a standard page structure where the `Transaction` component provides the specific transaction-related content.  This is a minor update, likely just integration of the `Transaction` component.

**Trade.jsx (5/26/2025, 5:11:11 PM):** This file contains commented-out code for a trading interface.  The commented code suggests the implementation of a candlestick chart, using a canvas and drawing functions to represent the chart and handle user interactions,  with data for currency pairs and candlestick data. The commented-out section seems to have contained a substantial amount of logic for rendering and updating a trading chart, but it is not currently functional in the provided commit.


## 11:12:27 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Java program, `B_Rakhsh_Revival` (later renamed `RakhshRevival`), solving a problem involving consecutive zeros in a string.  The initial versions (10:24 PM - 10:37 PM) dealt with an array of integers, attempting to replace sequences of three consecutive zeros with a one.  A significant shift occurred around 10:37 PM, changing the input to a string of '0's and '1's and the objective to minimizing the number of operations to ensure no substring of length *m* contains only '0's.  Each operation replaces *k* consecutive '0's with '1's.

Subsequent commits (10:37 PM - 11:07 PM) refine the algorithm's efficiency and readability.  Changes include:

* **Improved logic for applying the operation:**  Initial versions placed operations somewhat arbitrarily; later versions strategically position operations as far right as possible within the affected window to avoid unnecessary recalculations.

* **Optimization for skipping already processed sections:**  The algorithm is optimized to skip over sections of the string that have already been modified, improving its performance for large inputs.

* **Input/Output changes:** The program transitions from using `Scanner` for input to a more efficient `BufferedReader` for improved performance in handling multiple test cases.

* **Algorithm simplification:** Later versions streamline the logic, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.  The final versions efficiently calculate the number of operations needed.


The filename changed from `B_Rakhsh_Revival.java` to `RakhshRevival.java` at 11:00 PM.  The most significant changes in terms of algorithmic approach occurred between 10:37 PM and 11:07 PM, reflecting several iterations of optimization and refinement. The final version (11:07 PM) uses a `Scanner` again but with improved logic resulting in the most efficient code.
