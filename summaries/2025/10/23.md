# Activity Summary for 10/23/2025

## 12:36:23 AM
The code change log details the development of a backend assignment, focusing on user authentication, habit management, and habit tracking features. The changes follow a clear structure, separating concerns into controllers (handling HTTP requests) and services (containing business logic).

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\controllers\authController.js`**
    *   **Functionality:** This file consistently defines the `AuthController` class, which manages user authentication routes. It includes `register` and `login` methods.
    *   **Register Method:** Handles user sign-up by extracting `name`, `email`, and `password` from the request body, calling `authService.register`, and responding with a 201 status on success or 400 on error.
    *   **Login Method:** Handles user sign-in by extracting `email` and `password`, calling `authService.login`, and responding with a 200 status (including a JWT token and user details) on success, or 401 for invalid credentials.
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** While there were brief, transient empty file states around **10/22/2025, 10:53:30 PM** and **10:53:37 PM**, the core functionality was restored almost immediately and remained consistent. A minor cosmetic change to a comment was recorded at **10/22/2025, 10:54:22 PM**.

2.  **`c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\services\authService.js`**
    *   **Functionality:** This service provides the core business logic for user authentication. It integrates `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `jsonwebtoken` for JWT generation, and `supabase` for database operations. It also utilizes custom validators for email and password.
    *   **Register Logic:** Validates input fields, checks for existing users, hashes passwords with bcrypt, and inserts new user records into the `users` table, returning selected user details.
    *   **Login Logic:** Validates credentials, retrieves user data, compares passwords, generates a JWT token with `userId` and `email` payload (valid for 7 days using `process.env.JWT_SECRET`), and returns the token along with basic user information.
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** A significant change occurred at **10/22/2025, 11:11:54 PM**, where detailed English comments were briefly replaced with Hindi comments. This was quickly reverted to the original detailed English comments at **10/22/2025, 11:12:50 PM**, indicating a swift correction or an experimental change. The core logic remained unchanged across these versions.

3.  **`c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\services\habitService.js`**
    *   **Functionality:** This service manages all business logic related to user habits, interacting with Supabase for data persistence.
    *   **Methods:** Includes `createHabit` (validating title and frequency, handling optional description, tags, and reminder time), `getUserHabits` (retrieving habits for a user with optional tag filtering and pagination), `getHabitById` (fetching a specific habit by ID and user ownership), `updateHabit` (modifying an existing habit after ownership verification and frequency validation), and `deleteHabit` (removing a habit after ownership verification).
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** The initial functional implementation was captured at **10/22/2025, 11:42:36 PM**. A subsequent update at **10/23/2025, 12:00:24 AM** significantly improved code readability by adding comprehensive English comments throughout the file, explaining each function, parameter, and logical step.
    *   **Note:** An entry at **10/22/2025, 11:39:43 PM** was mislabeled with this service path but contained the content for `HabitController.js`.

4.  **`c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\controllers\habitController.js`**
    *   **Functionality:** This file defines the `HabitController` class, which handles HTTP requests for habit management. It delegates business logic to `habitService`.
    *   **Methods:** It provides endpoints for `createHabit`, `getAllHabits`, `getHabitById`, `updateHabit`, and `deleteHabit`. All methods extract `userId` from the JWT payload (implying middleware use) and handle request parameters and body data.
    *   **Error Handling:** All controller methods employ `try...catch` blocks to manage errors from the service layer, responding with appropriate HTTP status codes (201, 200, 400, 404).
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** The consistent implementation of this controller was logged at **10/22/2025, 11:42:48 PM**.

5.  **`c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\controllers\trackingController.js`**
    *   **Functionality:** This file defines the `TrackingController` class, responsible for handling HTTP requests related to habit tracking. It uses `trackingService` for its core operations.
    *   **Methods:** Includes `trackHabit` (marking a habit as completed for the day, requiring `userId` and `habitId`) and `getHabitHistory` (retrieving tracking history for a specific habit, ensuring user ownership).
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** The code for this controller remained consistent across entries at **10/23/2025, 12:27:32 AM** and **12:27:37 AM**.

6.  **`c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\services\trackingService.js`**
    *   **Functionality:** This service encapsulates the business logic for tracking habit completions and calculating streaks. It interacts directly with `supabase`.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   `trackHabit`: Verifies habit ownership, checks if the habit has already been tracked for the current day to prevent duplicates, and inserts a new completion log.
        *   `getHabitHistory`: Fetches tracking logs for a specific habit (owned by the user) for the last 7 days. It then calculates the current consecutive streak using a helper function.
        *   `calculateStreak` (Helper): A utility method that analyzes a list of completion dates to determine the longest current consecutive streak, correctly handling daily progressions and gaps.
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** The complete implementation of this service was logged at **10/23/2025, 12:30:51 AM**.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Architectural Pattern:** A consistent controller-service pattern is used, with controllers handling request/response flow and services containing core business logic.
*   **Database Interaction:** All services heavily rely on a `supabase` client (imported from `../config/database`) for all data persistence operations, demonstrating uniform database integration.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** The system uses JWT tokens (generated in `authService`) for authentication. All habit and tracking related services enforce authorization by consistently including `eq('user_id', userId)` in their Supabase queries, ensuring users can only access or modify their own data.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is present across all controllers and services, utilizing `try...catch` blocks in controllers to send appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 201, 200, 400, 401, 404) and custom `Error` messages thrown by services.
*   **Input Validation:** Services perform essential input validation (e.g., checking for required fields, email format, password strength, valid frequency values) before processing data or interacting with the database.
*   **Code Readability:** There is a clear pattern of enhancing code readability through detailed English comments, particularly evident in `authService` and `habitService` updates.
*   **Singleton Export:** All controllers and services are exported as single instances (`module.exports = new ClassName();`).
*   **Chronological Development:** The timestamp progression indicates a logical development flow, starting with authentication, moving to habit creation/management, and finally implementing habit tracking.
