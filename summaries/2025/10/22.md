# Activity Summary for 10/22/2025

## 11:36:00 PM
The code changes primarily involve two files related to an authentication system: `src\controllers\authController.js` and `src\services\authService.js`. All recorded changes occurred on 10/22/2025.

**File: `c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\controllers\authController.js`**

This file defines the `AuthController` class, which handles HTTP requests and responses for user registration and login. It imports `authService` to delegate the core business logic.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   `register` method: Extracts `name`, `email`, and `password` from the request body, calls `authService.register`, and responds with a `201 Created` status on success or `400 Bad Request` on error.
    *   `login` method: Extracts `email` and `password`, calls `authService.login`, and responds with a `200 OK` status containing the token and user info on success, or `401 Unauthorized` for invalid credentials.
*   **Timestamps and Changes:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 10:53:21 PM:** The initial, fully functional version of the controller was committed, establishing the `register` and `login` methods with clear error handling and status codes.
    *   **10/22/2025, 10:53:30 PM and 10:53:37 PM:** The file content was briefly empty, suggesting either accidental saves, deletions, or an intermediate state during development, quickly followed by restoration.
    *   **10/22/2025, 10:53:43 PM, 10:54:01 PM, and 10:54:22 PM:** The original code was restored and remained consistent, with only a minor stylistic change in a comment ("Defining the AuthController class" changed to "Define AuthController class") at the last timestamp.
*   **Overall:** The controller's structure and functionality remained stable throughout, focusing on input extraction, service delegation, and appropriate HTTP responses.

**File: `c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\services\authService.js`**

This file implements the core authentication business logic within the `AuthService` class. It uses `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `jsonwebtoken` for JWT generation, Supabase for database interactions, and custom validators.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   `register` method: Validates `name`, `email`, `password` format and presence, checks for existing users, hashes the password using `bcrypt` (salt rounds 10), inserts the new user into the 'users' table, and returns selected user data. It includes robust error handling for validation failures, duplicate emails, and database insertion errors.
    *   `login` method: Validates `email` and `password` presence, retrieves the user from the database, compares the provided password with the stored hashed password using `bcrypt.compare`, and generates a JWT token (valid for 7 days, using `process.env.JWT_SECRET`) containing `userId` and `email`. It returns the token and selected user details (excluding the password).
*   **Timestamps and Changes:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 11:11:46 PM:** The initial version of the service was committed. It included all core functionality (imports, registration, login, hashing, JWT generation) with detailed English comments. The login function's return statement was incomplete in its comment.
    *   **10/22/2025, 11:11:54 PM:** A significant change occurred where all comments were translated from English to Hindi. Crucially, the `login` method's return statement was completed to explicitly return `{ token, user: { id, name, email } }`.
    *   **10/22/2025, 11:12:50 PM:** The comments were reverted back to English. The improved `login` method's explicit return structure (introduced in the previous change) was retained. A module export comment was also added.
*   **Overall:** This file saw active development, with a temporary change to Hindi comments quickly reverted to English, while a functional improvement in the `login` method's return value was permanently incorporated. This file is central to the application's security and user management.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Modularity:** Clear separation of concerns between `controllers` (handling HTTP requests/responses) and `services` (encapsulating business logic).
*   **Error Handling:** Both files extensively use `try-catch` blocks and throw/handle specific errors with relevant messages and HTTP status codes (400, 401).
*   **Security Focus:** Use of `bcryptjs` for password hashing and `jsonwebtoken` for secure session management (JWTs).
*   **Database Interaction:** Both layers interact indirectly with a database via Supabase, with the `authService` encapsulating the direct data access logic.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close timestamps of changes, especially the brief empty states in `authController.js` and the comment language flip in `authService.js`, suggest rapid development, testing, or minor refactoring during a focused session.
