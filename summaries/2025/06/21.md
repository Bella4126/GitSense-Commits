# Activity Summary for 6/21/2025

## 12:21:01 AM
The log shows edits to `Zindex.html` on June 21st, 2025.  The file is an HTML document with basic styling.

Initially, the HTML contained two divs with class "container" and "conatiner" (note the typo).  Between 12:11 AM and 12:15 AM, CSS was added, starting with defining a `--super` variable set to blue in the `:root` selector.  The CSS then targeted paragraphs (`<p>`) and later the `.container` class, applying the `--super` variable as a background color.  There was a brief period where the class selector was incorrect (`.con` and `.conatiner` instead of `.container`).

Around 12:15 AM, the typo in "conatiner" was corrected to "container".  Later, between 12:18 AM and 12:20 AM, the divs with class `container` and `conatiner2` were commented out, and ultimately removed from the document by 12:19:52 AM.  The changes were made in quick succession, suggesting iterative development and debugging.  There are a couple of instances of almost identical consecutive commits (12:18:54 AM and 12:18:59 AM), possibly due to accidental repeated saves.  The final version keeps the page's basic structure with only a title and a `container` div (though it's now empty).
