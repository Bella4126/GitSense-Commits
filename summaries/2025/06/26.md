# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

The log shows a single entry for `d:\Notes\CSS\intro.html` modified on June 25th, 2025 at 9:38:20 PM.  This HTML file demonstrates CSS styling, specifically focusing on the `object-fit` property for images. The code includes inline styles to set body background and text color, and styles for two divs:  `.con` (with scrolling features) and `.img` (containing an image and using `object-fit: cover` to maintain aspect ratio).  Commented-out sections suggest earlier experimentation with a longer text paragraph within a div and the inclusion of a font-awesome script and external stylesheet (`style.css`), neither of which are currently used.  The final version displays an image from a Pixabay URL within the `.img` div, showcasing the `object-fit` functionality.
