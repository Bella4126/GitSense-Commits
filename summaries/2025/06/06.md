# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 11:52:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `Dashboard.jsx` component and the creation of a `Navbar.jsx` component.  `Dashboard.jsx` underwent significant changes, initially containing a fully functional dashboard UI with features like navigation, search, user profile, expense/voucher/booking sections, and account details.  Between 11:08 AM and 11:19 AM, the entire content of `Dashboard.jsx` was commented out. This was followed by further similar comment-outs at 11:33 AM and 11:49 AM, suggesting a possible iterative development or debugging process where the component's code was repeatedly commented out and potentially rewritten.

At 11:09 AM, `App.jsx` was updated to route `/courses` to the `Dashboard` component.

A new component, `Navbar.jsx`, was introduced at 11:50 AM.  This component provides a navigation bar with icons (from `lucide-react`), search functionality, and a user profile dropdown.  The `Navbar` uses state and refs to manage search and profile dropdown visibility, and employs event listeners to close these elements when clicking outside them.  The navbar has a consistent styling pattern using Tailwind CSS classes for styling elements.
