# Activity Summary for 6/15/2025

## 3:26:12 AM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ss\financeplus_frontend\src\Component\SecondPage.jsx`, a React component.  Both revisions are almost identical, focusing on a form with a text area, emotion selection buttons, and a "Complete" button.  The key difference lies in a minor UI adjustment within a five-minute period (11:30:46 PM to 11:35:43 PM on June 14th, 2025).

Specifically, the change involves the styling and positioning of the image icon within the text area. In the first revision, the icon is positioned using `bottom-4 right-4`, while in the second revision, it's changed to `top-4 right-4`, moving it from the bottom right to the top right corner of the text area.  The background color of the icon button also changed from `bg-gray-200` to `bg-transparent` with hover effect `hover:bg-white/10`.

The component uses state management (`useState`) for text input and selected emotions.  The `emotionTags` and `selectedFeelings` arrays remain unchanged, defining available emotion options and associated images.  The styling throughout the component extensively uses Tailwind CSS classes for layout and visual presentation.  No functional changes appear beyond the repositioning of the image icon in the text area.
