# Activity Summary for 6/27/2025

## 1:40:37 PM
The log shows development activity on a React application between 12:53 PM and 1:04 PM on June 27, 2025.  The primary focus was on `App.jsx` and `Ques1.jsx`, with later additions and changes to `Ques2.jsx`.

**`App.jsx` Updates:** The file underwent significant changes related to importing components. Initially, there were errors in the import path for `Ques1`.  The path was corrected several times, finally settling on `'./Question1/Ques1'`.  `Ques2` was imported around 12:54 PM, but later commented out at 12:58 PM, indicating a potential change in project scope or a temporary removal.  The `App` component itself was progressively developed, starting with an empty div and then incorporating `<Ques1 />` around 12:55 PM. The final state of the file utilizes more consistent styling and syntax.  Many of the changes here were closely spaced in time, indicative of rapid iterative development.

**`Ques1.jsx` Updates:** This component saw improvements to its rendering, starting with a basic `<h1>` tag and settling on "<h1>hi</h1>" by 12:55 PM and then again at 12:56 PM  with only minor formatting changes.

**`Ques2.jsx` Updates:**  This component's development is less coherent, showing fragmented code additions and deletions, beginning at 1:00 PM and lasting until 1:04 PM.  The code snippets suggest work-in-progress related to useState hook (1:03 PM) but lacks a clear, consistent structure throughout this period.


In summary, the majority of focused development was on `App.jsx` and `Ques1.jsx` between 12:53 PM and 12:58 PM.  `Ques2.jsx` shows less structured, experimental coding between 1:00 PM and 1:04 PM. The overall pattern suggests a build-up of the application structure, involving import corrections, component rendering, and some testing or experimental code in a separate component.


## 2:40:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a React-based URL shortener application.  The primary file modified is `Ques1.jsx`, undergoing several iterations between 2:02 PM and 2:39 PM.  These changes primarily focus on the `URLShortenerPage` component, refining the URL validation and form handling logic.  Initially, the `isValidURL` function was duplicated; later revisions consolidated this function and improved the `validateForm` function to handle edge cases and provide more specific error messages.  The `handleSubmit` function was also significantly altered, adding error handling and logic to process multiple forms simultaneously.  A `LoggingMiddleware` is consistently used throughout the component, logging various actions such as adding/removing URL forms, URL shortening process start and completion, and click recording.  The logging utilizes `localStorage` to store application logs and shortened URLs.  Around 2:12 PM and 2:18 PM the entire `Ques1.jsx` file was commented out, suggesting a potential temporary removal or a complete rewrite, followed by  more comments around 2:39PM.  There are also entries for `Ques2.jsx` which contains almost the same code as `Ques1.jsx` at 1:47 PM and 2:03 PM, indicating a potential duplication of the application logic across different files.


## 3:40:36 PM
The log shows modifications to a React application, specifically a URL shortener.  The `Ques1.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 2:48 PM and 2:52 PM on June 27, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `URLShortener` component.  The initial commit at 2:48 PM shows a functional but incomplete component. Subsequent commits added form validation (checking for valid URLs, alphanumeric shortcodes, and unique shortcodes), improved error handling in the `RedirectHandler` (simplifying the `catch` block), and minor styling updates, including adding a background color to form elements at 2:52 PM.  The changes are incremental and iterative, suggesting a development process involving continuous refinement.  The application uses `localStorage` to store shortened URLs and their associated data, including click tracking.  The application also features a user interface with a header containing navigation buttons for "Shortener" and "Statistics" tabs and supports custom shortcodes with validation for length and alphanumeric characters.  There's a separate file, `Ques2.jsx`, but its content is empty in the log.
