# Activity Summary for 6/27/2025

## 1:40:37 PM
The log shows development activity on a React application between 12:53 PM and 1:04 PM on June 27, 2025.  The primary focus was on `App.jsx` and `Ques1.jsx`, with later additions and changes to `Ques2.jsx`.

**`App.jsx` Updates:** The file underwent significant changes related to importing components. Initially, there were errors in the import path for `Ques1`.  The path was corrected several times, finally settling on `'./Question1/Ques1'`.  `Ques2` was imported around 12:54 PM, but later commented out at 12:58 PM, indicating a potential change in project scope or a temporary removal.  The `App` component itself was progressively developed, starting with an empty div and then incorporating `<Ques1 />` around 12:55 PM. The final state of the file utilizes more consistent styling and syntax.  Many of the changes here were closely spaced in time, indicative of rapid iterative development.

**`Ques1.jsx` Updates:** This component saw improvements to its rendering, starting with a basic `<h1>` tag and settling on "<h1>hi</h1>" by 12:55 PM and then again at 12:56 PM  with only minor formatting changes.

**`Ques2.jsx` Updates:**  This component's development is less coherent, showing fragmented code additions and deletions, beginning at 1:00 PM and lasting until 1:04 PM.  The code snippets suggest work-in-progress related to useState hook (1:03 PM) but lacks a clear, consistent structure throughout this period.


In summary, the majority of focused development was on `App.jsx` and `Ques1.jsx` between 12:53 PM and 12:58 PM.  `Ques2.jsx` shows less structured, experimental coding between 1:00 PM and 1:04 PM. The overall pattern suggests a build-up of the application structure, involving import corrections, component rendering, and some testing or experimental code in a separate component.
