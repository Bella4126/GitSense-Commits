# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 8:09:25 PM
The log shows edits to two HTML files: `Zindex.html` and `intro.html`.

`Zindex.html`  primarily involved styling a `.container2` div.  Initial changes (between 1:27 PM and 1:29 PM)  focused on removing commented-out code and  uncommenting and styling the `.container2` div using inline styles. A `--super` CSS variable was used to set the background color to blue. Between 1:29 PM and 1:34 PM,  further styling was added, including a red box-shadow,  and finally a white background color, dimensions, border-radius, padding, and centering using margin: auto. The body background was changed from black to white, and the text color to black.  Later edits, at approximately 1:34 PM, refined the styling, adding an inset box-shadow and setting `position: relative`.

`intro.html` shows a sequence of edits primarily focused on styling the body and adding a `div` with the class "con" and an image in a "img" div.  Initially (around 2:11 PM), there were modifications to inline styles and removing commented-out script and link tags. The body's background color was changed to black and the text color to white. Between 2:23 PM and 2:35 PM, multiple edits refined the styling of the `.con` and `.img` divs adding borders, dimensions, padding, and handling overflow using `overflow: scroll` and `overflow-x: auto`. The crucial change was the addition of  `object-fit` property to the `img` tag, experimenting with `cover`, `contain`, `none`, and finally settling on `cover` to control how the image fits within its container.  The  commented-out `<div class="con">` section  with a large paragraph of Lorem ipsum text was eventually removed.
