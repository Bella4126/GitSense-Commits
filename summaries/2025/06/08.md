# Activity Summary for 6/8/2025

## 9:06:09 PM
The log shows a single code change at 6/7/2025, 11:43:22 PM to `c:\Users\ss\LMS_Student_dashboard\src\Components\InteractivePieChart.jsx`.  This file contains a React component that renders an interactive pie chart using the D3.js library.  The chart displays three categories: Active, Won, and Lost, with corresponding colors and values (although the displayed values in the UI differ from the data used to generate the chart itself: 3,2,1 vs 32760, 32760, 2520). The component uses `useEffect` hook to draw the chart within an SVG element.  The code includes interactive elements such as mouseover and mouseout transitions for scaling the pie chart slices.  The component also includes a separate display of the data below the chart,  showing  the number for each category in text format. The discrepancy between the data used to generate the chart and the data displayed in the textual summary suggests a potential bug or area for improvement.
