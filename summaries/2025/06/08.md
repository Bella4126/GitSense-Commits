# Activity Summary for 6/8/2025

## 9:06:09 PM
The log shows a single code change at 6/7/2025, 11:43:22 PM to `c:\Users\ss\LMS_Student_dashboard\src\Components\InteractivePieChart.jsx`.  This file contains a React component that renders an interactive pie chart using the D3.js library.  The chart displays three categories: Active, Won, and Lost, with corresponding colors and values (although the displayed values in the UI differ from the data used to generate the chart itself: 3,2,1 vs 32760, 32760, 2520). The component uses `useEffect` hook to draw the chart within an SVG element.  The code includes interactive elements such as mouseover and mouseout transitions for scaling the pie chart slices.  The component also includes a separate display of the data below the chart,  showing  the number for each category in text format. The discrepancy between the data used to generate the chart and the data displayed in the textual summary suggests a potential bug or area for improvement.

The `page.jsx` file, last updated on 6/8/2025 at 11:40:14 PM, implements a login page component using React, Framer Motion for animations, and Lucide React for icons.  The component features a login form with email and password fields, password visibility toggle, "remember me" checkbox,  a "Forgot password?" link, and a Google login button (currently a placeholder).  Successful login simulates an API call and redirects to `/dashboard` after a 1.5-second delay, showing a success toast message.  The page also includes visual styling with cards, buttons, and animations.  The UI is styled with dark backgrounds and uses an emerald green color scheme.  A "back to home" link is provided to navigate to the root URL (`/`).  Finally, it includes a link to the registration page (`/auth/register`).  The code extensively uses UI components imported from the `@/components/ui` directory.
