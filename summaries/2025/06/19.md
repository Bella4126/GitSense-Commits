# Activity Summary for 6/19/2025

## 11:39:55 AM
The log shows development of a webpage using HTML and CSS.  The initial HTML file (`intro.html`) uses inline CSS styling and links to an external stylesheet (`style.css`).  The `property.css` file, created and modified repeatedly, details various CSS properties including `text-align`, `font-weight`, `text-decoration`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, and `font-family`. There's a significant focus on text styling for `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<p>` elements.  Several edits to `property.css` between 10:18:21 AM and 10:21:49 AM  involved minor corrections and refinements to selectors.

Between 10:20:00 AM and 10:21:49 AM, the `property.css` file shows experimentation with selectors for `<h3>`, changing from a class selector to an ID selector (`#h3`, `#h31`) and changing the text decoration. The final version uses `#234` to style an `<h3>` element with blue underline.

Around 10:23:53 AM a new stylesheet, `style.css`, was created, initially to style `<h2>` and `<p>` elements with color and background, and was then modified to incorporate `border`, `padding` and `margin` properties for `<h2>`, culminating in a series of refinements to these properties for `<h2>` between 10:24:34 AM and 10:27:37 AM to adjust margins and padding.  The `#234` id selector receives green background styling in this file, aligning with modifications in `property.css`.

Later changes (from 10:30:39 AM onwards) show work on positioning elements absolutely with `#Box1` and `#Box2` divs. There were multiple adjustments to padding, positioning, `position: absolute;`,  and floating elements (`float: left;`, `float: right;`) for these divs and paragraphs, with a final revision using `clear: both;` to resolve layout issues.  The border style for the boxes was also changed multiple times. The final styles for `#Box1` and `#Box2` are set to have solid borders, with `#Box2` using absolute positioning for its layout in the page. The `intro.html` file was updated to reflect the addition of divs.

Finally,  the stylesheet was updated to use pseudo-classes (`a:link`, `a:visited`, `a:hover`) for styling links. Additionally, a `li:nth-last-child(2)` selector is added, indicating styling applied to the second to last list item in an unordered list. This section is added at 11:08:05 AM. The entire process shows iterative design and debugging.


## 12:45:56 PM
The log shows development of a simple HTML page (`intro.html`) that uses an external CSS stylesheet (`style.css`).

On June 19th, 2025, starting at 12:17 PM, `intro.html` was initially created, linking to `style.css` for styling.  An inline style was commented out.

Between 12:19 PM and 12:21 PM, `style.css` underwent several iterations. Initially, a `text-shadow` was added to the `<h1>` element.  A `box-shadow` was then added. Finally, the styles were moved to a `:hover` pseudo-class, so the shadows only appear on hover.

At 12:33 PM, `intro.html` was updated.  A script from Font Awesome was included, and a Font Awesome icon (`<i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i>`) was added to the page.  This suggests the addition of icons to the page's design.  The overall pattern is iterative CSS development focused on styling the `<h1>` element, followed by the integration of Font Awesome for icons in the HTML file.
