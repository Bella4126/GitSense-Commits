# Activity Summary for 6/20/2025

## 11:21:02 PM
The log shows development of an HTML file (`Zindex.html`) and a CSS file (`style_.css`) for a responsive gallery.  The `Zindex.html` file underwent numerous revisions between 10:21 PM and 10:49 PM on June 20, 2025.

Initially, the HTML was a very basic structure.  Between 10:22 PM and 10:24 PM, the `<title>` tag was commented out. Then, around 10:27 PM, a `<h1>` tag with the text "Z index" was added.  Later, around 10:38 PM, a link to a Font Awesome CDN was added, and subsequently, two `<div>` elements with placeholder text were incorporated.  There were several minor text edits within the `<p>` tags over this period.

A significant change occurred around 10:44 PM, when the external CSS file (`style_.css`) was introduced, initially attempting to set the body background color to black within both the HTML file and the external stylesheet (`style_.css`)  There were some errors in the link to the external CSS file and this link was removed and readded several times.  Finally, around 10:49 PM the external stylesheet link was commented out, and the inline styles were added directly into the `<style>` tag within the `Zindex.html` to style the `container` and `conatiner` divs.  Note the typo in "conatiner". The final version includes inline styles defining the background color, text color, positioning, and `z-index` properties for the containers.


The `style_.css` file saw only minor changes, primarily toggling between incorrect and correct selectors for applying a black background color to the body. The final working styles were written directly to the Zindex.html file.
