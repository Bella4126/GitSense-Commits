The provided log only contains an entry for a `.env` file, which is excluded from summarization due to its potential to contain sensitive information like API keys.  Therefore, no summary of code changes can be provided.

The log shows iterative development of a React-based booking system component, `BookingContent.jsx`.  Significant changes occurred between 9:49 AM and 10:06 AM on June 14, 2025.

Initially (`9:49 AM`), `BookingContent.jsx` displayed bookings (flights, buses, hotels) based on filters ('all', 'upcoming', 'completed') and included a train enquiry form. The UI heavily used Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The 'New Booking' button was commented out.  No pagination was implemented.

A commented-out version of `BookingContent.jsx` appears in the log at `10:04 AM`, suggesting a complete rewrite or refactoring.

The final version at `10:06 AM` introduced several key changes:

* **Addition of Train Enquiry History:**  A section displaying past train enquiries was added.  This history includes `id`, `from`, `to`, `date`, `passengers`, `classType`, `status`, `enquiryDate`, and status styling (`statusColor`, `statusBg`).  All enquiries in the example data are marked as 'Confirmed'.

* **Pagination:** Pagination was implemented to display train enquiries, using `currentPage` and `itemsPerPage` states to manage the display.  Navigation arrows (`ChevronLeft`, `ChevronRight`) were added.

* **Icon updates:**  `Clock` and `CheckCircle` icons from `lucide-react` were added, presumably for visual cues in the train enquiry history.


The `BookingPage.jsx` file (`9:54 AM`) provides context, showing how `BookingContent.jsx` is integrated into a larger booking system page. It manages state for active tabs, filters, form visibility, and sample booking data.  This file remained largely unchanged throughout the log.  The sample booking data includes `isUpcoming` flags, used for filtering.  The `handleTrainEnquiry` function logs the enquiry details to the console and displays a success alert. The `handleNewBooking` and `handleBookingSubmit` functions manage the booking form.  The overall architecture uses functional components and state management with `useState`.
