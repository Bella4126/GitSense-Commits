# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 12:44:47 AM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ss\Downloads\BIS\project\app\(auth)\login\page.jsx`, a React component for a login page.  Both revisions are nearly identical, with the only difference being a minor wording change in the "Don't have an account?" message.  The first revision uses "Don't have an account?", while the second revision uses "Do not have an account?".  This change occurred between 12:00:26 AM and 12:01:02 AM on June 9th, 2025.

The code itself implements a login form with email and password fields, a password visibility toggle, a "remember me" checkbox, a "forgot password" link, and a Google login button (currently a placeholder).  The styling utilizes a dark theme with emerald accents.  The component uses several libraries including `framer-motion` for animations, `lucide-react` for icons, and `sonner` for toasts.  The form submission simulates an API call and redirects to '/dashboard' upon successful login.

The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\ss\Downloads\BIS\project\app\page.jsx` on June 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve a React component representing a landing page for "Defence Connect," a platform for defence exam aspirants.

The first few revisions (1:43:46 PM, 1:44:10 PM, 1:44:25 PM) appear to be minor edits with no substantial code changes.  The only noticeable difference between these revisions is a change in the `Join Now` button in the navigation bar in the third revision (1:44:25 PM), where the `bg-emerald-600` class was added, indicating a style update.

The final revision (1:52:40 PM) is also nearly identical to the previous revisions, suggesting further minor adjustments or potentially just a save without significant code alterations.  The overall code structure and functionality seem consistent across all revisions. The code uses `framer-motion` for animations, `next/link` for navigation, and `lucide-react` for icons. The page includes sections for navigation, a hero section with animated counters, features, communities, and testimonials.  The code is well-structured and uses a component-based approach with reusable components like `FeatureCard` and `TestimonialCard`.
