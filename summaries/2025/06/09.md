# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 12:44:47 AM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ss\Downloads\BIS\project\app\(auth)\login\page.jsx`, a React component for a login page.  Both revisions are nearly identical, with the only difference being a minor wording change in the "Don't have an account?" message.  The first revision uses "Don't have an account?", while the second revision uses "Do not have an account?".  This change occurred between 12:00:26 AM and 12:01:02 AM on June 9th, 2025.

The code itself implements a login form with email and password fields, a password visibility toggle, a "remember me" checkbox, a "forgot password" link, and a Google login button (currently a placeholder).  The styling utilizes a dark theme with emerald accents.  The component uses several libraries including `framer-motion` for animations, `lucide-react` for icons, and `sonner` for toasts.  The form submission simulates an API call and redirects to '/dashboard' upon successful login.
