# Activity Summary for 11/5/2025

## 12:51:40 AM
The primary change logged on **11/4/2025, 1:35:56 PM** involves the implementation of `c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\controllers\authController.js`.

This file defines the `AuthController` class, which is responsible for handling user authentication requests. It includes two main asynchronous methods:

1.  **`register`**: This method processes user registration requests. It extracts `name`, `email`, and `password` from the request body, delegates the user creation logic to `authService.register`, and responds with a `201 Created` status and the new user's details upon successful registration. If an error occurs, it sends a `400 Bad Request` with an error message.
2.  **`login`**: This method handles user login requests. It takes `email` and `password` from the request body, calls `authService.login` for authentication, and on success, returns a `200 OK` status with a JWT token and the authenticated user's information. In case of authentication failure, it sends a `401 Unauthorized` status with an error message.

A recurring pattern observed in both methods is the structured approach to handling requests: extracting data from `req.body`, delegating complex logic to a service layer (`authService`), and robust error handling by catching exceptions and returning appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON error messages. The controller is designed as a class, and an instance is exported for use in routing.

The code changes primarily focus on implementing core authentication functionalities for a backend assignment.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\controllers\authController.js` (Timestamp: 11/4/2025, 1:35:56 PM):** This file introduces the `AuthController` class, which handles user registration and login requests. It delegates the actual business logic to an `authService`, processes request bodies for user credentials, and sends appropriate HTTP responses (201 for successful registration, 200 for successful login, and 400/401 for errors). This marks the initial implementation of the authentication API endpoints.
*   **`src\middleware\auth.js` (Timestamps: 11/5/2025, 1:30:42 AM - 1:31:54 AM):** This file defines the `authenticateToken` middleware, crucial for protecting routes that require authentication. It extracts the JWT from the `Authorization` header, verifies its validity using `jwt.verify` and `process.env.JWT_SECRET`, and, if valid, attaches the user's information to the request object (`req.user`). It implements error handling for missing (401) or invalid/expired (403) tokens. Subsequent changes to this file within a short timeframe were minor comment refinements, clarifying the purpose of code sections like token verification and the `next()` middleware call.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **November 4, 2025, 1:35:56 PM:** The `authController.js` file was created, establishing the primary logic for user authentication.
*   **November 5, 2025, 1:30:42 AM:** The `auth.js` middleware was initially implemented, providing the essential JWT verification logic for protected routes.
*   The rapid succession of minor updates to `src\middleware\auth.js` between 1:30:42 AM and 1:31:54 AM on November 5, 2025, indicates immediate post-creation refinement, likely focused on improving code clarity through comments.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Both the `authController` methods and the general approach imply the use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`) for operations that involve I/O, such as interacting with a database or an authentication service.
*   **Structured Error Handling:** Errors are consistently caught and responded to with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 401, 403) and a JSON error message, indicating a standard approach to API error reporting.
*   **JWT-based Authentication:** The system relies on JWTs for user authentication, with tokens being issued upon successful login and verified by a middleware for subsequent protected requests.
*   **Environment Variables:** The use of `process.env.JWT_SECRET` highlights the practice of storing sensitive configuration details securely in environment variables.
*   **Code Commenting:** The `auth.js` middleware specifically includes comments in Hindi, suggesting a localized approach to in-code documentation.
