The primary change logged on **11/4/2025, 1:35:56 PM** involves the implementation of `c:\Users\ss\Downloads\Backend Assignment\src\controllers\authController.js`.

This file defines the `AuthController` class, which is responsible for handling user authentication requests. It includes two main asynchronous methods:

1.  **`register`**: This method processes user registration requests. It extracts `name`, `email`, and `password` from the request body, delegates the user creation logic to `authService.register`, and responds with a `201 Created` status and the new user's details upon successful registration. If an error occurs, it sends a `400 Bad Request` with an error message.
2.  **`login`**: This method handles user login requests. It takes `email` and `password` from the request body, calls `authService.login` for authentication, and on success, returns a `200 OK` status with a JWT token and the authenticated user's information. In case of authentication failure, it sends a `401 Unauthorized` status with an error message.

A recurring pattern observed in both methods is the structured approach to handling requests: extracting data from `req.body`, delegating complex logic to a service layer (`authService`), and robust error handling by catching exceptions and returning appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON error messages. The controller is designed as a class, and an instance is exported for use in routing.
