# Activity Summary for 11/4/2025

## 1:37:53 PM
The file `src\controllers\authController.js` was last modified on 11/4/2025 at 1:35:56 PM. This file defines the `AuthController` class, which handles user authentication requests by interacting with an `authService`.

Key updates in `src\controllers\authController.js` include:
*   **Registration Endpoint (`register` method):** This `async` method is responsible for user registration. It extracts `name`, `email`, and `password` from the request body, calls `authService.register`, and responds with a `201 Created` status on successful user creation, returning a success message and the new user's details. Errors are caught and result in a `400 Bad Request` status with an error message.
*   **Login Endpoint (`login` method):** This `async` method handles user login. It takes `email` and `password` from the request body, calls `authService.login`, and on success, responds with a `200 OK` status, providing a success message, a JWT token, and the user's details. Authentication failures lead to a `401 Unauthorized` status with an error message.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   Both controller methods (`register` and `login`) are `async` functions, indicating they perform asynchronous operations, likely database interactions or token generation.
*   They consistently use `try...catch` blocks for robust error handling, returning specific HTTP status codes (201, 200 for success; 400, 401 for errors) and JSON responses containing either a `message` and data or an `error` message.
*   Input data (e.g., user credentials) is consistently extracted from `req.body`.
*   Both methods delegate core business logic to an `authService`, promoting separation of concerns.

The `src\controllers\authController.js` file, last modified on 11/4/2025 at 1:35:56 PM, defines an `AuthController` class responsible for managing user authentication flows. This controller imports and utilizes an `authService` for handling the core business logic.

Key functionalities include:
*   **`register` method**: Asynchronously handles user registration requests. It extracts `name`, `email`, and `password` from the request body, delegates the registration process to `authService.register`, and responds with a 201 status code and user data upon successful registration, or a 400 status with an error message if registration fails.
*   **`login` method**: Asynchronously handles user login requests. It retrieves `email` and `password` from the request body, calls `authService.login` for authentication, and on success, returns a 200 status code along with a JWT token and user details. If login fails, it responds with a 401 status code and an error message.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   Both methods employ `async/await` for asynchronous operations.
*   Error handling is consistently implemented using `try...catch` blocks, returning specific HTTP status codes (201, 200, 400, 401) and JSON responses containing either success messages and data or error details.
*   There is a clear separation of concerns, with the controller delegating complex logic to a service layer (`authService`).
*   The controller is designed as a class, and an instance of it is exported for use in routes.
