The file `src\controllers\authController.js` was last modified on 11/4/2025 at 1:35:56 PM. This file defines the `AuthController` class, which handles user authentication requests by interacting with an `authService`.

Key updates in `src\controllers\authController.js` include:
*   **Registration Endpoint (`register` method):** This `async` method is responsible for user registration. It extracts `name`, `email`, and `password` from the request body, calls `authService.register`, and responds with a `201 Created` status on successful user creation, returning a success message and the new user's details. Errors are caught and result in a `400 Bad Request` status with an error message.
*   **Login Endpoint (`login` method):** This `async` method handles user login. It takes `email` and `password` from the request body, calls `authService.login`, and on success, responds with a `200 OK` status, providing a success message, a JWT token, and the user's details. Authentication failures lead to a `401 Unauthorized` status with an error message.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   Both controller methods (`register` and `login`) are `async` functions, indicating they perform asynchronous operations, likely database interactions or token generation.
*   They consistently use `try...catch` blocks for robust error handling, returning specific HTTP status codes (201, 200 for success; 400, 401 for errors) and JSON responses containing either a `message` and data or an `error` message.
*   Input data (e.g., user credentials) is consistently extracted from `req.body`.
*   Both methods delegate core business logic to an `authService`, promoting separation of concerns.
